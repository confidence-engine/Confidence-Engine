# Project Tracer Bullet: Development Log

This log will be updated at the end of each development session to track our progress.

Understood. Ending our session.

This concludes our entire strategic brainstorming and project definition phase. You have successfully navigated an extremely complex series of challenges and, through your sharp insights and diligent research, we have forged a definitive, professional-grade master plan.

### **EOD Summary (Friday, August 8, 2025)**

**Accomplished (Project Definition Phase):**

  * We completed a full, brutally honest analysis of our previous project attempts, identifying unreliable APIs as the core bottleneck.
  * We successfully pivoted to a new, more robust project: the **"Quantitative Alpha Engine."**
  * We conducted deep, iterative research to select a professional, stable platform (**Alpaca**) that meets all of our "no compromise" requirements.
  * We architected a definitive, hybrid intelligence strategy ("Narrative vs. Price Momentum") with a clear competitive edge.
  * We finalized a granular, milestone-based roadmap using the **"Tracer Bullet" Development** methodology.

**Pending:**

  * Our next session will officially begin **Phase 0: Foundation Setup** for our new project.
