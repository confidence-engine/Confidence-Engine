# Project Tracer Bullet: Development Log

This log will be updated at the end of each development session to track our progress.

Understood. Ending our session.

This concludes our entire strategic brainstorming and project definition phase. You have successfully navigated an extremely complex series of challenges and, through your sharp insights and diligent research, we have forged a definitive, professional-grade master plan.

### **EOD Summary (Friday, August 8, 2025)**

**Accomplished (Project Definition Phase):**

  * We completed a full, brutally honest analysis of our previous project attempts, identifying unreliable APIs as the core bottleneck.
  * We successfully pivoted to a new, more robust project: the **"Quantitative Alpha Engine."**
  * We conducted deep, iterative research to select a professional, stable platform (**Alpaca**) that meets all of our "no compromise" requirements.
  * We architected a definitive, hybrid intelligence strategy ("Narrative vs. Price Momentum") with a clear competitive edge.
  * We finalized a granular, milestone-based roadmap using the **"Tracer Bullet" Development** methodology.

**Pending:**

  * Our next session will officially begin **Phase 0: Foundation Setup** for our new project.

### **README & Documentation Update**

When you return, you can commit all the documentation files we created. Here is a final, consolidated version for your records.

**Commit Message:**
`docs: Finalize official project charter, roadmap, and wiki`

**Final `README.md` Content:**

```markdown
# Project: Tracer Bullet
> **Product Name:** The Quantitative Alpha Engine
> **Status:** Phase 0 - Foundation Setup

## Mission Statement
To build a professional-grade, autonomous trading agent that finds and exploits short-term, sentiment-driven inefficiencies in the stock and crypto markets. The primary goal is the deep acquisition of elite skills in AI development, data engineering, and quantitative finance.

### **Phase 0: Strategy & Planning (`COMPLETED`)**
- **Date:** August 8, 2025
- **Summary:** Completed a multi-day strategic brainstorming phase. After analyzing the failures of previous API-dependent approaches, we have pivoted to a definitive, "no compromise" project: The "Quantitative Alpha Engine." The project will be built on the professional-grade Alpaca API, using a "Tracer Bullet" development methodology. The final project charter, roadmap, and tech stack have been approved.

### Test Question

According to our new "Tracer Bullet" roadmap, what is the single, simple objective of our very first coding script, `tracer_bullet.py`?

# Dev log summary (2025-08-09)

- Added multi-source ingest: Perplexity Pro API with key rotation; CoinDesk RSS.
- Implemented robust FinBERT sentiment: MAD outlier removal + trimmed mean on relevant-only.
- Enriched BTC topic; tuned relevance gating; added keyword fallback.
- Narrative built from accepted headlines; conservative confidence fallback.
- Provenance tagging for accepted; persisted accepted headlines to runs/<id>_accepted.txt.
- Adaptive divergence trigger based on volume Z.
- Debug utilities: inspect_env_pplx, test_pplx_auth, debug_sources.
- Console output improvements: accepted sources/score list, relevance top-5, clear decision preview.
- Auto-commit of artifacts retained; JSON includes robust sentiment details and Perplexity provenance.
## Post-initial-commit updates (Agent V1.1)
- Integrated per-source weighted relevance; using weighted score for acceptance thresholding.
- Enforced Perplexity recency filter to "day" for fresher coverage; retained rotation.
- Replaced process-focused preview with alpha-first summary and actionable next steps.
- Wired Telegram push: auto-sends alpha summary with top evidence to configured chat.
- Restored summary/detail in payload for DB schema alignment; ensured JSON carries alpha_* fields and weighted relevance details.
