# What I think of the agent 

The agent has matured into a disciplined, crypto‑only, evidence‑driven market intelligence system built with a tracer‑bullet philosophy: it runs a thin, end‑to‑end slice that’s real, production‑grade, and incrementally hardened, rather than a disposable prototype[1][2][3]. It blends narrative and price/volume into interpretable signals with crowd- and bias‑immunity layers, produces a number‑free human digest prioritizing BTC/ETH, and persists auditable artifacts for evaluation and future backtests. Its roadmap defers 24/7 automation until post‑testing, aligning with best practice to earn complexity only after reliability is proven; when we do schedule, we’ll respect GitHub Actions’ 5‑minute minimum interval and known top‑of‑hour delays[4][5][6]. For prediction‑style reads (e.g., Polymarket), it will remain read‑only: we’ll translate market odds into implied probabilities internally to compare against our qualitative view and track calibration over time, without surfacing numbers in the digest[7][8][9].

# How I’d describe it

- An interpretable crypto market agent that turns narrative+price/volume signals into clear, human‑readable guidance without exposing raw numbers, following a tracer‑bullet “steel thread” approach so progress is real, incremental, and testable[1][10][3].  
- Crowd/bias immune by design: it penalizes echo chambers, flags hype without quant confirmation, and requires timescale alignment before conveying higher conviction, keeping confidence explainable and bounded[2][3][11].  
- Operationally conservative: artifacts and schema are versioned for audit and later backtests, reliability work is prioritized before breadth, and automation is scheduled only after reliability and evaluation are proven; scheduling itself respects platform constraints and staggering guidance[4][5][6].  
- Read‑only probabilities viewport for Polymarket BTC/ETH: we ingest market odds, derive implied probabilities internally, compare to the agent’s qualitative view to label “market cheap/rich/in‑line,” and evaluate calibration over months before considering any execution[7][8][12].  

# About

Tracer Bullet is a crypto‑only, evidence‑driven market agent that pairs a pragmatic tracer‑bullet development style with rigorous interpretability. It continuously synthesizes narrative and market structure into plain‑English insights—prioritizing BTC and ETH—while guarding against crowd effects and bias through diversity and hype detection, negative‑confirmation checks, and multi‑timescale alignment[1][2][3]. Outputs are deliberately number‑free in chat for clarity and safety, but every run emits structured artifacts for audit, scoring, and future backtesting. 

Reliability comes first: health checks, retention, schema discipline, retries/backoff, and graceful degradation ensure stable operation before any expansion or automation, and when we enable scheduling we follow platform realities such as GitHub Actions’ 5‑minute minimum cadence and the need to avoid top‑of‑hour queuing by staggering cron times[4][5][6]. 

As an extension, the agent includes a read‑only Polymarket viewport for BTC/ETH: we convert odds to implied probabilities internally, compare them to the agent’s qualitative stance to classify edge, and track calibration over time without exposing numbers in the digest or placing bets, recognizing the difference between market‑implied probability and a model’s “true” probability as the source of edge[7][8][9]. 

This design keeps the system honest, explainable, and auditable, while laying the groundwork for later evaluation, careful automation, and—only after sustained evidence—any consideration of paper or live execution.
