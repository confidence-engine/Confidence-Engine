#### **🧠 Continuous Learning During Testing:**
1. **ML Retraining**: Every 30 days (first cycle: October 4, 2025)
2. **Kelly Criterion**: Adjusting position sizes based on actual win/loss ratios
3. **Epsilon-Greedy**: 15% exploration trades for diverse learning
4. **Parameter Optimization**: Weekly backtest-driven updates
5. **Market Data Collection**: 43,200+ bars per asset over 30 days

#### **📊 Expected Testing Period Results:**
- **Trade Volume**: 300-500+ actual trades across both agents
- **Performance Data**: Win rates, P&L, signal quality metrics
- **Learning Evidence**: Strategy evolution, risk optimization
- **Market Experience**: Testing across different market conditions
