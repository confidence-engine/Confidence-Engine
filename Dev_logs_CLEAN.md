# Tracer Bullet — Dev Logs (Clean)

A concise development history highlighting milestones, major features, testing, and operational controls.

---

## Milestones (high level)
- v1–v2: Thin-thread agent; end-to-end runs; Telegram DM prototype.
- v3.1: Multi-asset universe, crypto TF expansion, digest formatting/sending.
- v4.x (bridge): Polymarket providers/bridge via Perplexity Pro API, internal probability.
- v3.4: Evaluation pipeline — metrics, runner, ingest, weekly wrapper, auto-commit/push.
- v4.3 (in progress): Reliability hardening — retries/backoff, degraded-run markers, ops polish.

---

## Major features by area
- Universe scanning and artifacts
  - Multi-asset scan with crypto TFs (1h/4h/1D/1W/1M).
  - Enriched artifacts: evidence_line per asset; top-level `polymarket` array.
  - Auto-commit/push of universe artifacts (`TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT`, `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_PUSH`).
- Digest delivery (Telegram/Discord)
  - Telegram splitter, crypto-only mode; Discord chunked embeds; strict no-send flags.
  - Number-free chat evidence; artifacts retain all metrics.
- Polymarket (PPLX-only)
  - `providers/polymarket_pplx.py`: key rotation, strict JSON parse, enforced `sonar` model.
  - `scripts/polymarket_bridge.py`: filtering/window/liquidity keywords, cap, internal_prob calibration.
  - Numbers gated in chat (`TB_POLYMARKET_NUMBERS_IN_CHAT=0`), optional empty render.
- Evaluation (v3.4)
  - `scripts/eval_metrics.py`: Brier, log-loss, calibration, cohorts.
  - `scripts/eval_runner.py`: scans `eval_data/resolved/*.csv`, writes `eval_runs/<ts>/`.
  - `scripts/eval_ingest.py`: dedup + monthly CSVs; `scripts/eval_weekly.py` wrapper.
  - Auto-commit/push for outputs and optional input data (`TB_EVAL_*`).
- Ops & reliability (v4.3)
  - `autocommit.py`; push gating via env; retries/backoff and degraded-mode in progress.

---

## Testing & validation
- Unit tests for metrics and artifact schema.
- Lightweight test runner: `scripts/run_eval_tests.py`.
- Dry-runs with no-send flags to verify chat formatting and provider behavior.

---

## Latest (v4.5 — Dual-Loop Production Trading System)
- **Live Trading**: Both hybrid crypto and high-risk futures loops operational in production.
- **Platform Integration**: Real Binance testnet API with proper quantity precision handling.
- **Risk Management**: $100 margin cap, 25x leverage cap, dynamic risk-reward calculations active.
- **Database**: SQLite auto-commit working, enhanced_trading.db tracked in GitHub.
- **Monitoring**: Full logging, Discord/Telegram notifications, process verification working.
- **Status**: 9 total trades executed, both loops stable and performing as designed.

---

## Latest (v3.1.16 — digest A+ + plain-English)
- Parity: Telegram and Discord both tag `[A+ Setup]` in headers and `(A+)` in Quick Summary.
- Readability: Executive Take, Weekly Plan, Engine Thesis simplified to plain English.
- Safety: Heuristic requires actionable stance, now/near timing, TF alignment, strong/elevated signal, non-high risk.
- Status: Full test suite passing (103/103).

---

## Key env controls
- Messaging safety: `TB_HUMAN_DIGEST`, `TB_NO_TELEGRAM`, `TB_NO_DISCORD`.
- Universe git ops: `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT`, `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_PUSH`.
- Evaluation git ops: `TB_EVAL_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT`, `TB_EVAL_GIT_PUSH`, `TB_EVAL_GIT_INCLUDE_DATA`.
- Polymarket: `TB_POLYMARKET_DEBUG`, `TB_POLYMARKET_SHOW_EMPTY`, `TB_POLYMARKET_NUMBERS_IN_CHAT`.
- Perplexity keys: `PPLX_API_KEY` or rotated `PPLX_API_KEY_1..N`.

---

## Current focus / next
- Reliability ops (v4.3): finalize retries/backoff, degraded-run markers, self-checks.
- Optional calibration plots for evaluation.
- CI/scheduler for weekly evaluation snapshots (optional).

## Latest (2025-08-20 — nightly self-checks + auto-commit scope)
- Clean docs refreshed:
  - `README_CLEAN.md`: added 5.2 “Nightly self‑checks & artifact auto‑commit” (tunables, quick CLI, scope).
  - `Roadmap_CLEAN.md`: date/status and Now→Near→Next note nightly hit‑rate self‑checks and broadened non‑.py auto‑commit.
- Nightly workflow policy: stage all; unstage `*.py`; push only artifacts/docs (e.g., `runs/*.json`, `universe_runs/metrics.csv`, `eval_runs/*`, `bars/*`).
