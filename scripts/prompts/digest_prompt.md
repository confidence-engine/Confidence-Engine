# Human Digest Formatter Style Guide

## Core Principles
- **Number-free**: Never use numerical values or percentages
- **Crypto-first**: Always prioritize crypto assets (BTC/ETH first, others secondary)
- **Conversational**: Use plain English, confident tone
- **Risk-focused**: Emphasize risk bands and readiness over exact values

## Output Structure

### Executive Take
- Big picture overview
- Crypto-first perspective
- Overall market sentiment

### BTC/USD Section
- Risk | Readiness | Action header format
- What's going on (narrative summary)
- Why we see it (checklist format):
  * Cross-horizon analysis
  * Participation
  * Signal quality
  * Price vs story
- Levels to watch (descriptive, no numbers)
- Entry ideas (2 bullets)
- Exit and invalidation
- Sizing (by risk band)

### ETH/USD Section

### Other Majors
- One-liners for other crypto assets

### Equities Background

### Playbook

## Tone and Rules
- Conversational, plain-English, confident
- No numbers or symbols (no %, no ratios)
- Do not expose raw field names
- Crypto always first; equities de-emphasized

## Input Fields (Inferred)
- Per asset: polarity (bullish/bearish/mild)
- Confidence band (very high/strong/moderate/low)
- Volume state (hot/normal/quiet)
- Alignment (strong/mixed/fragmented)
- Quality tags (broad/mixed/hype-prone)
- Readiness (Now/Near/Later)
- Sizing band (Low/Medium/High)
- Rationale from sentiment/news/structure vs price

## Conservative Inference
- If any field is missing, infer conservatively
- Still produce a complete digest even with partial data
