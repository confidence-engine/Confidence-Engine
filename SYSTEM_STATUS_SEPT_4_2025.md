## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED

### Module Import Resolution
**Problem**: Hybrid agent failing with ModuleNotFoundError for:
- `local_sentiment_analyzer`
- `precision_manager` 
- `validation_analyzer`

**Solution**: Created custom implementations with full functionality:

#### local_sentiment_analyzer.py ✅
```python
# Keyword-based sentiment analysis
- Positive words: bull, bullish, up, gain, rise, surge, rally
- Negative words: bear, bearish, down, fall, drop, crash  
- Scoring: 0.1 per keyword, capped [-1.0, 1.0]
- Aggregation: MAD outlier removal + trimmed mean
```

#### precision_manager.py ✅  
```python
# Crypto-specific precision rules for Alpaca
- BTC/ETH: 6 decimal quantities, 2 decimal prices
- DOGE: 0 decimal quantities (whole numbers)
- SOL/AVAX: 4 decimal quantities
- Validation: $1 minimum order value
```

#### validation_analyzer.py ✅
```python
# Pre-trade signal validation
- Required fields: symbol, direction, confidence
- Range validation: confidence [0,1], valid directions
- Symbol format: must contain '/' and 'USD'  
- Comprehensive reporting and history tracking
```
