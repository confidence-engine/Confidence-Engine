That’s a good metaphor, and it aligns with our design. Here’s an even tighter plain-English version tailored to what Tracer Bullet actually does now and where it’s going.

What we’re building
- An intelligent market detective that compares the story (news/sentiment) with the facts (price/volume), 24/7.

What it does differently
- It doesn’t chase headlines or price alone. It hunts for divergences—when the narrative and price disagree—and ignores noise.

How it works (today)
- Reads headlines, keeps only the most relevant, and scores sentiment.
- Analyzes price/volume across short, mid, and long windows; checks if those windows agree.
- Applies “crowd immunity”:
  - Boosts confidence if multiple independent sources report it.
  - Penalizes echo chambers and hype without price/volume confirmation.
- Adds small penalties when confirmations don’t line up (e.g., weak volume).
- Converts confidence into a suggested position size (informational), explains the reasoning, and sends a concise summary.

Why this is an edge
- Markets often overreact to noisy stories or ignore important ones. Systematically finding and filtering these contradictions is where alpha lives.

Where it’s going next
- Scan many assets (crypto + stocks), rank the best opportunities, and send a Top-N digest.
- Backtest outcomes to learn which patterns work, then evolve from rule-based to learning-driven.
- Eventually size and execute trades under strict risk and portfolio controls.

In one line
- Tracer Bullet is a disciplined market intelligence engine that spots story-vs-price contradictions, filters hype, explains itself, and suggests risk—on its way to becoming a multi-asset, learning “alpha factory.”
