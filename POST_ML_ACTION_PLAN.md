# ðŸš€ POST-ML ACTION PLAN: Path to High Accuracy & Success

*Implementation Date: September 3, 2025*

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission: Achieve High Accuracy with Core Signals Only

With ML components removed, we now focus on perfecting the fundamental alpha signals:
- **Sentiment vs Price Divergence**
- **Technical Analysis Confluence** 
- **Market Regime Awareness**
- **Dynamic Risk Management**

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Signal Quality & Market Regime (Week 1)

### **1.1 Implement Signal Quality Score**

**Goal**: Replace binary "trade/no-trade" with a quality score (0-10)

**File**: `divergence.py` - Enhance the `compute` function

```python
def calculate_signal_quality(sentiment_score, price_momentum, volume_z_score, news_volume):
    """
    Calculate signal quality score from 0-10
    Higher score = higher conviction trade
    """
    quality = 0.0
    
    # Sentiment strength (0-4 points)
    sentiment_abs = abs(sentiment_score)
    if sentiment_abs > 0.8: quality += 4.0
    elif sentiment_abs > 0.6: quality += 3.0
    elif sentiment_abs > 0.4: quality += 2.0
    elif sentiment_abs > 0.2: quality += 1.0
    
    # Price momentum clarity (0-3 points)
    price_abs = abs(price_momentum)
    if price_abs > 0.8: quality += 3.0
    elif price_abs > 0.6: quality += 2.0
    elif price_abs > 0.4: quality += 1.0
    
    # Volume confirmation (0-2 points)
    if volume_z_score > 1.5: quality += 2.0
    elif volume_z_score > 0.5: quality += 1.0
    
    # News volume factor (0-1 points)
    # Contrarian trades stronger with low news volume
    # Momentum trades stronger with high news volume
    is_contrarian = (sentiment_score > 0 and price_momentum < 0) or (sentiment_score < 0 and price_momentum > 0)
    if is_contrarian and news_volume < 5: quality += 1.0
    elif not is_contrarian and news_volume > 10: quality += 1.0
    
    return min(quality, 10.0)
```

**Integration**: Agent only trades on signals with quality >= 7.0

### **1.2 Market Regime Detection Integration**

**Goal**: Different strategies for trending vs ranging markets

**File**: `scripts/hybrid_crypto_trader.py` - Main decision logic

```python
from market_regime_detector import MarketRegimeDetector

# Initialize regime detector
regime_detector = MarketRegimeDetector()

def enhanced_trading_decision(symbol, sentiment, price_data, volume_data):
    """
    Enhanced decision logic with market regime awareness
    """
    # Detect current market regime
    regime = regime_detector.detect_regime(price_data)
    logger.info(f"Market regime for {symbol}: {regime}")
    
    # Calculate basic signals
    divergence_score = compute_divergence(sentiment, price_data)
    signal_quality = calculate_signal_quality(sentiment, price_data, volume_data)
    
    # Apply regime-specific filters
    if regime == 'ranging':
        # In ranging markets, only take high-quality divergence trades
        if signal_quality < 8.0:
            logger.info("Ranging market: Signal quality too low")
            return "hold"
        
        # Block momentum trades in ranging markets
        is_momentum = (sentiment > 0 and price_momentum > 0) or (sentiment < 0 and price_momentum < 0)
        if is_momentum:
            logger.info("Ranging market: Blocking momentum trade")
            return "hold"
            
    elif regime == 'trending':
        # In trending markets, allow both divergence and momentum
        if signal_quality < 6.0:  # Lower threshold for trending
            logger.info("Trending market: Signal quality too low")
            return "hold"
    
    # Make final decision
    if signal_quality >= 7.0:
        return "buy" if sentiment > 0 else "sell"
    
    return "hold"
```

### **1.3 Volatility-Based Position Sizing**

**Goal**: Adjust position size based on current volatility

**File**: `sizing.py` or integrate into `calc_position_size`

```python
def calc_volatility_adjusted_size(base_size, current_atr, avg_atr_20):
    """
    Adjust position size based on volatility
    High volatility = smaller size
    Low volatility = larger size (up to 2x)
    """
    if avg_atr_20 == 0:
        return base_size
    
    volatility_ratio = current_atr / avg_atr_20
    
    # Inverse relationship: high vol = smaller size
    volatility_adjustment = min(2.0, max(0.5, 1.0 / volatility_ratio))
    
    adjusted_size = base_size * volatility_adjustment
    
    logger.info(f"Volatility adjustment: ratio={volatility_ratio:.2f}, "
                f"multiplier={volatility_adjustment:.2f}, "
                f"size: {base_size:.6f} â†’ {adjusted_size:.6f}")
    
    return adjusted_size
```

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: Entry/Exit Optimization (Week 2)

### **2.1 Dynamic Take-Profit and Stop-Loss**

**Goal**: Use market structure instead of static percentages

```python
def calculate_dynamic_levels(symbol, entry_price, direction, bars_data):
    """
    Calculate TP/SL based on recent swing highs/lows
    """
    highs = bars_data['high'].rolling(20).max()
    lows = bars_data['low'].rolling(20).min()
    
    current_high = highs.iloc[-1]
    current_low = lows.iloc[-1]
    atr = calculate_atr(bars_data, 14)
    
    if direction == "buy":
        # Take profit just below recent resistance
        take_profit = current_high - (atr * 0.5)
        # Stop loss just below recent support
        stop_loss = current_low - (atr * 0.25)
        
        # Ensure minimum risk/reward ratio of 1.5:1
        risk = entry_price - stop_loss
        reward = take_profit - entry_price
        
        if reward / risk < 1.5:
            take_profit = entry_price + (risk * 1.5)
            
    else:  # sell
        # Take profit just above recent support
        take_profit = current_low + (atr * 0.5)
        # Stop loss just above recent resistance
        stop_loss = current_high + (atr * 0.25)
        
        # Ensure minimum risk/reward ratio
        risk = stop_loss - entry_price
        reward = entry_price - take_profit
        
        if reward / risk < 1.5:
            take_profit = entry_price - (risk * 1.5)
    
    return take_profit, stop_loss
```

### **2.2 Confirmation Filter**

**Goal**: Wait for price confirmation before entering

```python
def wait_for_confirmation(symbol, signal_direction, current_price, last_signal_price):
    """
    Wait for small price confirmation in signal direction
    """
    if signal_direction == "buy":
        # Wait for price to move higher than signal candle
        confirmation = current_price > last_signal_price * 1.001  # 0.1% higher
    else:
        # Wait for price to move lower than signal candle
        confirmation = current_price < last_signal_price * 0.999  # 0.1% lower
    
    if confirmation:
        logger.info(f"Confirmation received for {signal_direction} signal")
        return True
    else:
        logger.info(f"Waiting for confirmation: current={current_price}, signal={last_signal_price}")
        return False
```

### **2.3 Unified Conviction Scoring**

**Goal**: Combine all factors into single conviction score

```python
def calculate_conviction_score(signal_quality, regime_alignment, volatility_score, confirmation_score):
    """
    Calculate overall conviction score (1-10)
    Only trade on scores >= 7
    """
    # Signal Quality: 40% weight (0-4 points)
    quality_points = (signal_quality / 10.0) * 4.0
    
    # Regime Alignment: 30% weight (0-3 points)
    regime_points = regime_alignment * 3.0
    
    # Volatility: 20% weight (0-2 points)
    vol_points = volatility_score * 2.0
    
    # Confirmation: 10% weight (0-1 points)
    conf_points = confirmation_score * 1.0
    
    total_conviction = quality_points + regime_points + vol_points + conf_points
    
    logger.info(f"Conviction breakdown: quality={quality_points:.1f}, "
                f"regime={regime_points:.1f}, vol={vol_points:.1f}, "
                f"conf={conf_points:.1f}, total={total_conviction:.1f}")
    
    return min(total_conviction, 10.0)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3-4)

### **3.1 Multi-Timeframe Analysis**

```python
def multi_timeframe_confluence(symbol):
    """
    Check confluence across 15m, 1h, 4h timeframes
    """
    signals_15m = analyze_timeframe(symbol, "15Min")
    signals_1h = analyze_timeframe(symbol, "1Hour") 
    signals_4h = analyze_timeframe(symbol, "4Hour")
    
    confluence_score = 0
    if signals_15m['direction'] == signals_1h['direction']: confluence_score += 1
    if signals_1h['direction'] == signals_4h['direction']: confluence_score += 1
    if signals_15m['direction'] == signals_4h['direction']: confluence_score += 1
    
    return confluence_score / 3.0  # 0-1 score
```

### **3.2 Adaptive Threshold System**

```python
class AdaptiveThresholds:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_quality_threshold = 7.0
        self.trade_frequency_target = 5  # trades per week
        self.recent_trades = []
    
    def adjust_thresholds(self):
        """Auto-adjust thresholds based on trade frequency"""
        weekly_trades = len([t for t in self.recent_trades if self.is_recent_week(t)])
        
        if weekly_trades < 2:
            # Too few trades, lower thresholds
            self.base_quality_threshold = max(5.0, self.base_quality_threshold - 0.5)
            logger.info(f"Lowered quality threshold to {self.base_quality_threshold}")
        elif weekly_trades > 8:
            # Too many trades, raise thresholds
            self.base_quality_threshold = min(9.0, self.base_quality_threshold + 0.5)
            logger.info(f"Raised quality threshold to {self.base_quality_threshold}")
    
    def get_current_threshold(self):
        return self.base_quality_threshold
```
