## ðŸ”® Hybrid Crypto Agent Self-Improvement (Multi-Layered)

### 1. ML Retraining Every 30 Days
- **Automatic Model Updates**: `TB_ML_RETRAIN_EVERY_SEC=2592000` (30 days)
- **Continuous Background Process**: ML retrainer runs in parallel loop
- **PyTorch Model Evolution**: Updates `eval_runs/ml/latest/model.pt` with new market data
- **Feature Engineering**: Rebuilds features from accumulated bars/ directory
- **Location**: `scripts/ml_retrainer.py` running as background daemon

### 2. Weekly Parameter Optimization
- **Backtest-Driven**: `weekly_propose_canary.sh` runs performance analysis
- **Auto-Apply**: Promotes best parameters to `config/promoted_params.json`
- **Adaptive Gating**: ML gate thresholds auto-adjust based on performance
- **Trigger**: Automatic when promoted params are >8 days old

### 3. Real-Time Exploration & Learning
- **Epsilon-Greedy**: 10% random exploration trades (`TB_EPSILON_PCT=10`)
- **Exploration Windows**: Minutes 10-20 each hour use relaxed thresholds
- **Adaptive Risk**: Kelly Criterion + performance tracking adjusts position sizes
- **Mode Switching**: Normal/Window/Epsilon modes with different risk profiles

### 4. Ensemble Learning
- **Multiple Models**: AttentionMLP, LSTM, CNN, Transformer predictors
- **Weight Updates**: Model weights adjust based on recent performance
- **Meta-Learning**: Higher-level model learns to combine base models
- **Feature Importance**: Dynamic attention mechanisms identify key market signals

## ðŸš€ Futures Agent Self-Improvement (Performance-Based)

### 1. Kelly Criterion Evolution
- **Win/Loss Tracking**: Continuously updates `win_count`, `loss_count`, `total_wins`, `total_losses`
- **Dynamic Sizing**: After 10+ trades, Kelly Criterion adjusts position sizes based on actual performance
- **Risk Adaptation**: Risk per trade scales from 0.3% up to 15% based on historical win rate
- **Mathematical Formula**: `kelly_risk = min(0.15, kelly_size / platform_capital)`

### 2. Real-Time Performance Learning
- **Intelligent TP/SL**: Adapts stop-losses based on market conditions (`TB_INTELLIGENT_FUTURES_TPSL`)
- **Regime Detection**: Adjusts strategy based on volatility and trend regimes
- **Trade Validation**: Each trade updates performance metrics for future decisions
- **Performance Tracking**: Win rate influences future risk allocation

### 3. Conservative Learning Safeguards
- **Ultra-Conservative Base**: 0.3% risk per trade, 5x max leverage
- **Gradual Scaling**: Only increases risk after proven track record
- **Emergency Systems**: Hard caps prevent catastrophic losses during learning
- **Minimum Trade Threshold**: Kelly sizing only activates after 10+ completed trades

## ðŸ“Š Learning Timeline for 2-4 Week Operation

### Week 1: Foundation Building
- **Hybrid**: Starts with conservative defaults, begins accumulating performance data
- **Futures**: Ultra-conservative 0.3% risk, starts tracking win/loss ratios
- **ML Background**: Continuous feature collection from all trades

### Week 2: Initial Adaptation
- **Hybrid**: First weekly parameter update based on performance
- **Futures**: Kelly sizing activates after 10+ trades (if reached)
- **Model Learning**: Patterns start emerging in ensemble weights

### Week 3: Intelligence Emergence
- **Hybrid**: ML models begin learning market-specific patterns
- **Futures**: Performance-based risk adjustments become active
- **Exploration**: Epsilon-greedy discovers new profitable opportunities

### Week 4: Advanced Evolution
- **Hybrid**: First 30-day ML retrain cycle with accumulated data
- **Futures**: Optimized Kelly ratios based on proven performance
- **System**: Both agents operating with learned parameters and strategies

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Learning Outcomes

After 2-4 weeks of autonomous operation, both agents will have:

1. **Learned Market Patterns**: Specific to your trading timeframes and assets
2. **Optimized Risk Profiles**: Based on actual performance, not theoretical models
3. **Evolved Strategies**: Through systematic exploration and validation
4. **Accumulated Wisdom**: Comprehensive performance database for future decisions
5. **Enhanced Intelligence**: ML models trained on real trading data

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Hybrid Agent Learning Loop
```bash
# Background ML retraining (30-day cycles)
while true; do
  python3 scripts/ml_retrainer.py --bars_dir bars --out_root eval_runs/ml --link_dir eval_runs/ml/latest
  sleep 2592000  # 30 days
done

# Main trading loop with exploration
while true; do
  # Epsilon-greedy exploration (10% random)
  # Exploration windows (minutes 10-20 each hour)
  # Dynamic threshold adjustment
  python3 scripts/hybrid_crypto_trader.py
  sleep 60
done
```

### Futures Agent Learning Mechanisms
```python
# Kelly Criterion after 10+ trades
if self.kelly_sizer and (self.win_count + self.loss_count) >= 10:
    win_probability = self.win_count / total_trades
    kelly_size = self.kelly_sizer.calculate_kelly_size(
        win_probability, win_loss_ratio, regime_factor
    )
    kelly_risk = min(0.15, kelly_size / platform_capital)

# Performance tracking for continuous improvement
if pnl_amount > 0:
    self.win_count += 1
    self.total_wins += pnl_amount
else:
    self.loss_count += 1
    self.total_losses += abs(pnl_amount)
```

## ðŸš¨ Safety & Risk Management

### Learning Constraints
- **Maximum Risk**: 15% per trade (Kelly cap for futures), 5 max positions (hybrid)
- **Conservative Base**: Always maintains ultra-conservative foundation
- **Circuit Breakers**: Emergency shutdown on excessive losses
- **Gradual Scaling**: Learning happens incrementally, not dramatically

### Monitoring & Alerts
- **Heartbeat System**: Regular Discord/Telegram notifications
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed logs of all learning adjustments
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic fallback to conservative defaults on failures
- **Auto-Commit**: All learning artifacts preserved for analysis

**ðŸŽ¯ Result**: Both agents are now equipped for extended autonomous operation with continuous learning and self-improvement. They will return significantly more intelligent and optimized for your specific market conditions.

**âš¡ Ready for 2-4 week autonomous operation with confidence!**
