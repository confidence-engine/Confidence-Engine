# Confidence Engine ‚Äî Institutional-Grade Multi-Asset Divergence Engine
> Looking for the concise version? See [README_CLEAN.md](README_CLEAN.md) | [Enhanced Features Summary](ENHANCED_HYBRID_SUMMARY.md)

## üöÄ Latest: Zero-Cost Industrial Enhancements Complete

**NEW**: Industrial-grade reliability features implemented at **$0 cost** using only free Python libraries:

- **üõ°Ô∏è Circuit Breaker Pattern**: API failures no longer crash the system
- **üíæ SQLite State Management**: More reliable data storage with automatic JSON migration  
- **‚ö° Async Processing**: Parallel data fetching for improved performance
- **üìä Performance Tracking**: Real-time uptime, trade count, and error monitoring
- **üîß Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and continued operation

**Status**: All enhancements operational in production | **Cost**: $0 | **Libraries**: sqlite3, concurrent.futures, functools

## Our Mission: Exploit Emotional-Math Gaps with Perfect Discipline

Financial markets are driven by human emotion as much as by fundamentals. Crowd fear, greed, and narrative bias often cause prices to diverge significantly from their true, statistical values ‚Äî creating opportunities for disciplined, rational traders.

**Confidence Engine is not just another sentiment bot. It is a purpose-built divergence engine, designed to detect the market‚Äôs ‚Äúlie‚Äù between story and price, and deliver actionable alpha signals in real time.**

We ask the key question nonstop:

> *"The news narrative is strongly positive (or negative), but why hasn‚Äôt the price moved yet? Is the market underreacting or overreacting?"*

By measuring and quantifying these divergences rigorously, filtering for relevance and confidence, and adapting thresholds dynamically, Confidence Engine provides **real-time, explainable**, and **action-ready** trading signals ‚Äî all delivered with evidence and playbook guidance directly to your Telegram DM.

## Why Confidence Engine Is Now Institutional-Grade

- **Multi-Asset Portfolio:** Advanced portfolio management across BTC/USD, ETH/USD, SOL/USD, and LINK/USD with correlation controls
- **Kelly Optimal Sizing:** Dynamic position sizing using Kelly Criterion based on win probability and expected returns  
- **Advanced Risk Management:** Portfolio VaR limits, individual position limits, and regime-based risk adjustments
- **Market Regime Detection:** Bull/bear/sideways regime classification with volatility and momentum analysis
- **Adaptive Learning:** Real-time parameter optimization with exploration windows and performance tracking
- **Philosophy-first:** We shipped a fast, end‚Äëto‚Äëend prototype (V1) to validate our core edge early, avoiding premature complexity.
- **Elegant simplicity:** We leverage two clean, high-quality signal pillars ‚Äî Alpaca price data and Perplexity synthesized narrative ‚Äî before adding noisy social feeds.
- **Hybrid intelligence:** Combining quantitative ‚Äúoracle‚Äù data and qualitative ‚Äúpsychologist‚Äù narrative to find true market inefficiencies.
- **Divergence over sentiment:** Unlike traditional news sentiment bots, we trade the **gap** between narrative and price, where predictable emotional mistakes happen.
- **Adaptive and auditable:** Confidence shaping, source weighting, catalyst tagging, and full payload provenance ensure discipline and continuous improvement.
- **Generalizes beyond crypto:** While BTC/ETH are emphasized today, the approach extends to equities, ETFs, FX, rates, and other markets; Polymarket is optional, not required.

## How We Work

- Ingest multi-source crypto news with semantic filtering for asset relevance.
- Score narrative sentiment versus price/volume context.
- Compute divergence signal with adaptive thresholds.
- Generate concise alpha-first summaries and next steps.
- Deliver signals and evidence automatically via Telegram DMs.
- Persist rich data for audit, backtesting, and iterative tuning.

Summary
An always-on research and trading agent that spots short-term mispricings by comparing what the story says (news-driven narrative momentum) to what the tape shows (price momentum). When those disagree in a meaningful, well-defined way, the agent takes a paper trade with full explainability, logs everything to a local database, and sends a Telegram ‚Äústyle analysis‚Äù message you can read in one glance.

Philosophy (my version)
- Mastery through evidence: Every idea is a hypothesis with a falsifiable test. We promote or kill based on data.
- Thin thread first: Always get an end-to-end path running before adding features. Complexity earns its way in.
- Explainability as a feature: If we can‚Äôt justify a signal in one paragraph, we don‚Äôt trade it.
- Two independent eyes: LLM narrative and FinBERT sentiment cross-check each other; TA/volume validates the tape side.
- Time is a feature: Narrative impact decays; events matter; regimes change. We model decay and use event triggers.
- Reliability beats cleverness: Strict schemas, retries, key rotation, circuit breakers, and idempotent orders protect edge.
- Anti-overfit protocols: Small, interpretable feature set; walk-forward validation; cohort analytics; no indicator soup.
- Incremental risk: Paper ‚Üí tiny live ‚Üí scale where evidence persists.
- Human-in-the-loop: Telegram ‚Äústyle analysis‚Äù for every signal; review on cadence, not mid-drawdown emotion.
- Build your own dataset: The real moat is the corpus of divergence signals with reasons and outcomes.

Core Idea
- Narrative Momentum: A score from ‚àí1 to +1 derived from LLM narrative polarity/confidence on recent headlines, blended with FinBERT sentiment, discounted by time decay. New, credible stories matter more; old ones fade.
- Price Momentum: A score from ‚àí1 to +1 from simple, interpretable indicators: RSI, short-vs-medium MA slope, MACD histogram (acceleration), volume z-score (participation), with optional ATR context.
- Divergence: narrative_z ‚àí price_z. Large positive: price may be lagging good story. Large negative: price may be lagging bad story. Only act when confidence and risk checks pass.

Tech Stack (and why)
- Language/IDE: Python 3.10+ in Cursor AI (GPT-5) for rapid scaffolding, refactors, and TDD support.
- Market Data & Trading: Alpaca (paper) for prices, headlines, and execution. Free, stable, and live-parity API.
- LLM/Narrative: Perplexity Pro API for production narrative synthesis (you already have keys). In dev, a local adapter to iterate prompts without burning credits.
- NLP: FinBERT (ProsusAI) via Hugging Face for financial sentiment on headlines; spaCy for keywords/entities.
- Analytics: pandas/numpy for indicators and normalization; APScheduler for periodic/event-driven runs.
- Storage/Logging: SQLite for durable local logs of prompts, signals, trades, and raw payloads.
- Notifications: python-telegram-bot for real-time signal messages with ‚Äústyle analysis.‚Äù
- Testing/Quality: pytest, coverage, black/isort/ruff, pre-commit, python-dotenv for configuration.

Why this stack: It‚Äôs zero-cost for V1, reliable, widely used, and easy to harden. Clean upgrade paths exist for streaming, dashboards, and deployment.

Architecture
- Data
  - alpaca_fetcher: bars and headlines from Alpaca; optional yfinance for backtests.
- Narrative Adapters
  - narrative_local: development adapter (Cursor) for prompt/schema iteration.
  - narrative_perplexity: production adapter with key rotation, retries, timeouts, strict JSON validation, and repair-then-reject.
- NLP
  - sentiment_finbert: batch headline sentiment ‚Üí continuous score in [‚àí1, +1].
  - keyword_extractor: entities/keywords for explainability and novelty.
- Analysis
  - price_momentum: RSI, MA slope (e.g., 10 vs 50), MACD histogram, volume z-score, optional ATR context ‚Üí scaled to [‚àí1, +1].
  - narrative_momentum: LLM polarity + confidence blended with FinBERT; exponential time decay with configurable half-life.
  - divergence: z-score normalization and divergence calculation; thresholds and reason codes.
- Execution & Risk
  - trade_executor: Alpaca paper orders with unique client order IDs for idempotency; market-first with optional limits later.
  - risk: per-symbol cooldown, max positions, min volume credibility, timed exits.
- Orchestration
  - agent: APScheduler job to run scans; optional event triggers on headline deltas; graceful error handling and degradation paths.
- Persistence & Notifs
  - db_manager: SQLite tables for prompts, signals, trades; raw JSON blobs preserved.
  - telegram_notifier: structured ‚Äústyle analysis‚Äù message for each signal; optional heartbeat.

Data Contracts
Narrative JSON (must validate before use)
- narrative_summary: string
- narrative_momentum_score: float in [-1, 1]
- confidence: float in 
- salient_entities: list of strings
- anchor_quotes: list of short strings
- metadata (optional): { source_sample: list[str], model_name: str, created_at: iso8601 }

Parser policy: validate against a typed schema; attempt one repair for minor JSON issues; if still invalid, skip trading and log the sample.

Decision Blueprint
- Inputs:
  - Narrative Score = weighted blend of LLM polarity and FinBERT sentiment, decayed over time.
  - Price Score = composite from normalized RSI, MA slope, MACD histogram; down-weight if volume z-score is weak.
- Divergence:
  - divergence = z(narrative) ‚àí z(price).
- Trigger (initial defaults, to be tuned):
  - abs(divergence) > 1.0,
  - narrative confidence > 0.6,
  - volume credibility floor (e.g., volume z > ‚àí0.5),
  - cooldown satisfied.
- V1: long-only. Shorts considered later after backtesting and guardrails.
- Explainability: store the summary, key quotes, indicators, scores, thresholds, and reason_code for each signal.

Reliability
- API failure handling: retries with backoff, Perplexity key rotation, timeouts, and circuit breakers to pause narrative calls if failure rate spikes.
- Degradation paths:
  - Narrative down ‚Üí TA-only mode or skip entries.
  - Market data down ‚Üí pause trading; keep logging narratives if available.
- Orders: unique client order IDs avoid duplicate fills on retry.
- Alerts: Telegram on critical errors and circuit-breaker events.

Backtesting Integrity
- Event-ordered replay: process bars and headlines strictly by timestamp.
- Point-in-time features only: lag everything properly; no future info in current decisions.
- Validation: in-sample tuning vs. out-of-sample testing; walk-forward to mirror deployment; robustness checks to small parameter changes.
- Cohorts: measure by asset, time-of-day, volatility regime, and event type.

2) Environment
- Clone repo, create a venv, install requirements.
- Copy .env.example ‚Üí .env; fill ALPACA, PERPLEXITY, TELEGRAM values.

3) First Run (preview mode)
- Run tracer_bullet.py for BTCUSD. It fetches prices/headlines, produces narrative JSON via dev adapter, computes TA and divergence, and prints a decision preview. No orders yet.

4) Paper Trading
- Flip the execution flag to enable Alpaca paper orders once previews look sane.
- Watch SQLite and Telegram messages for ‚Äústyle analysis‚Äù evidence.

# Tracer Bullet V1 ‚Äì README (Consolidated)

This document consolidates architecture, configuration, runbook, file summaries, dev log, roadmap, changelog, and a suggested commit message for the Agent V1 release.

---

## 1) Overview

Agent V1 ingests multi-source crypto headlines (Perplexity Pro API with key rotation, CoinDesk RSS, Alpaca), deduplicates, semantically filters for BTC relevance, computes robust FinBERT sentiment on relevant-only headlines, builds a narrative from accepted headlines with confidence heuristics, applies decay, scores price/volume, computes divergence, and makes a guarded decision with an adaptive trigger. It exports JSON, bars CSV, and accepted headlines TXT, then auto-commits artifacts.

Key features:
- Multi-source ingest with Perplexity key rotation
- Robust sentiment: MAD outlier removal + 10% trimmed mean
- Narrative built from accepted headlines; conservative confidence fallback
- Adaptive divergence trigger (volume-aware)
- Provenance tagging for accepted headlines

***

## Evaluation pipeline (v3.4)

### Inputs
- Source CSVs at `eval_data/resolved/*.csv` (often monthly via `eval_ingest.py`)
- Required columns: `id,asset,title,closed_at,market_prob,internal_prob,outcome,cohort`

### Metrics computed
- Brier score, log‚Äëloss
- Calibration bins (to CSV), with optional plot (can be added)
- Cohort win‚Äërates (by asset or provided cohort)

### Usage
- Run unit tests:
```
python3 scripts/run_eval_tests.py
```
- Ingest resolved rows (dedup, grouped by closed_at month):
```
python3 scripts/eval_ingest.py --input path/to/resolved_batch.csv
```
- Run evaluator (writes `eval_runs/<ts>/`):
```
python3 scripts/eval_runner.py
```
- Weekly wrapper (same as runner, convenient entrypoint):
```
python3 scripts/eval_weekly.py
```

### Auto‚Äëcommit/push of eval artifacts
- Controlled by env flags (see below). When enabled, `eval_runner.py` and `eval_ingest.py` will stage/commit and optionally push outputs:
  - `TB_EVAL_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=1`
  - `TB_EVAL_GIT_PUSH=1`
  - `TB_EVAL_GIT_INCLUDE_DATA=1` to include `eval_data/resolved/` in the same commit

***

## Auto‚Äëcommit & Git ops (universe + evaluation)

- Universe artifacts (JSON/CSV) ‚Äî set in `.env`:
  - `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=1`
  - `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_PUSH=1`
  - Artifacts: `universe_runs/‚Ä¶`, plus optional mirrors to `runs/`

- Evaluation artifacts (see above) ‚Äî set in `.env`:
  - `TB_EVAL_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=1`
  - `TB_EVAL_GIT_PUSH=1`
  - `TB_EVAL_GIT_INCLUDE_DATA=1` (optional)

Commit messages are prefixed (e.g., `eval: metrics <ts>`), and pushes are gated by the `*_PUSH` flags.

***

## Hit‚Äërate self‚Äëchecks & nightly automation

- Asset hit‚Äërate checks compute 1h/4h/1D directional correctness by joining `universe_runs/*.json` with `bars/*.csv`.
- Tunables:
  - `TB_HITRATE_SIDEWAYS_EPS` (default 0.1): sideways band in percent.
  - `TB_HITRATE_W_1H`, `TB_HITRATE_W_4H`, `TB_HITRATE_W_1D` (default 1.0): horizon weights for weighted vote.
  - `TB_HITRATE_REG_THRESH` (default 0.05): nightly regression threshold.
- Nightly workflow `.github/workflows/safe_qa_nightly.yml` runs in safe mode, appends trend to `eval_runs/hit_rate_trend.csv`, logs regression compare, and commits non‚Äë.py artifacts.
- Auto‚Äëcommit scope in nightly: stages all changes and then unstages `*.py`, ensuring artifacts like `runs/*.json`, `universe_runs/metrics.csv`, `eval_runs/*`, and `bars/*` are pushed.

Quick CLI:
```
python scripts/asset_hit_rate.py --runs_dir universe_runs --bars_dir bars --runs_map_dir runs --debug \
  --failures_csv eval_runs/hit_rate_failures.csv --markdown_out eval_runs/hit_rate_summary.md
```

***

## Payload schema v3.2 (artifact highlights)

- Evidence line: per‚Äëasset `evidence_line` persisted for explainability (number‚Äëfree in chat; numeric context kept in artifacts).
- Thesis snapshot: top‚Äëlevel `thesis` preserves `action`, `risk_band`, and `readiness` used for headers.
- Per‚Äëtimeframe plan snapshot: `plan[tf]` with `entries`/`invalidation`/`targets`, plus `source` (`analysis|fallback`) and `explain` (plain English "Outcome").
- Timescale scores: `timescale_scores` now use `price_change_pct` (renamed from `price_move_pct`) and include `alignment_flag`.
- Polymarket array: top‚Äëlevel `polymarket[]` when discovery is enabled; artifacts keep probabilities even when chat hides numbers.

See `docs/payload.md` for the complete spec and examples.

### Deterministic consistency gate

Use the gate to verify back‚Äëto‚Äëback universe scans are identical under a safe, deterministic profile. CI can run this after unit tests.

Usage (safe, no sends, no git side effects):
```
TB_DETERMINISTIC=1 TB_NO_TELEGRAM=1 TB_NO_DISCORD=1 \
TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=0 TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_PUSH=0 \
python3 scripts/consistency_check.py --config config/universe.yaml --top 10
```

Exit code is non‚Äëzero on drift; logs print the first diff (payload tuple or ranking) to help isolate causes.

- Chat number gating: hide numbers in TG/Discord via `TB_POLYMARKET_NUMBERS_IN_CHAT=0` (artifacts keep numbers)
- Always‚Äërender empty state if desired: `TB_POLYMARKET_SHOW_EMPTY=1`

***

## Digest delivery (Telegram & Discord)

- Telegram:
  - `scripts/tg_sender.py` respects `TB_HUMAN_DIGEST`/`TB_NO_TELEGRAM`; splits long messages safely
  - Crypto‚Äëonly mode: `TB_DIGEST_TELEGRAM_CRYPTO_ONLY=1`
- Discord:
  - `scripts/discord_sender.py` sends chunked embeds; respects `TB_NO_DISCORD`
- Evidence lines in chat are number‚Äëfree; artifacts retain numeric metrics
- Confidence display can be toggled for chat:
  - `TB_POLYMARKET_SHOW_CONFIDENCE=0`
  - `TB_SHOW_ASSET_CONFIDENCE_IN_CHAT=0`

Paritised features (Telegram + Discord):
- A+ setups: assets qualifying as high‚Äëquality setups show `[A+ Setup]` in headers and `(A+)` in Quick Summary coin lines.
- Kid‚Äëfriendly Quick Summary: end‚Äëof‚Äëdigest recap of big picture, leaders, and simple plan.
- Plain‚ÄëEnglish phrasing: Executive Take, Weekly Plan, and Engine Thesis are simplified for readability.

***

## Underrated Scanner (utility‚Äëonly, latest only)

- Purpose: discover freshly underrated utility crypto projects and alert with evidence.
- Provider: Perplexity API (key rotation); enrichment: CoinGecko market cap + liquidity.
- Filters: exclude memecoins/presales ("meme", "pepe", "inu", "presale", etc.), hype keywords ("viral", "pump"), large‚Äëcap staples (BTC/ETH/XRP/BNB/ADA/DOGE/SOL/etc.), and generic "ecosystem" entries.
- Recency: prompts request `recent_date` and `recent_evidence`; optional hard gate requires items within the last N hours.
- Smart re‚Äëinclude: previously alerted items are considered again only if they have a new `recent_date` within your window.
- Formatter parity: Telegram and Discord underrated alerts render the same fields and ordering.

Environment variables (.env):
```
# Discovery window and selection
TB_UNDERRATED_PPLX_HOURS=72
TB_UNDERRATED_TOP_N=20

# Dedup/re‚Äëinclude controls
TB_UNDERRATED_FORCE_ALERTS=0           # one‚Äëoff bulk include of top‚ÄëN
TB_UNDERRATED_REINCLUDE_RECENT=1       # allow if recent again
TB_UNDERRATED_REQUIRE_RECENT=0         # hard gate on recent_date

# Enrichment threshold and outputs
TB_UNDERRATED_MARKETCAP_THRESHOLD=10000000
TB_UNDERRATED_STORE=data/underrated_store.json
TB_UNDERRATED_OUTDIR=underrated_runs

# Sends and git ops (artifacts/docs only; never .py)
TB_UNDERRATED_ALERT_DISCORD=1
TB_UNDERRATED_ALERT_TELEGRAM=1
TB_UNDERRATED_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=1
TB_UNDERRATED_GIT_PUSH=1
```

Run examples:
- Safe preview (no sends, no git side effects):
```
TB_NO_TELEGRAM=1 TB_NO_DISCORD=1 \
TB_UNDERRATED_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=0 TB_UNDERRATED_GIT_PUSH=0 \
python3 scripts/underrated_scanner.py
```

- Strict freshness with sends (e.g., last 72h) and smart re‚Äëinclude:
```
TB_UNDERRATED_RUN_INTERVAL_DAYS=0 \
TB_UNDERRATED_PPLX_HOURS=72 TB_UNDERRATED_TOP_N=20 \
TB_UNDERRATED_REQUIRE_RECENT=1 TB_UNDERRATED_REINCLUDE_RECENT=1 \

TB_PPLX_TIMEOUT=45 TB_PPLX_BACKOFF=0.2 \
python3 scripts/underrated_scanner.py
```

Notes:
- Auto‚Äëcommit only stages `underrated_runs/` and `data/underrated_store.json` (plus Dev_logs.md when updated). Scripts are never committed.
- Configure dedicated Discord webhook via `DISCORD_UNDERRATED_WEBHOOK_URL` or fall back to existing digest hooks.

***

## Reliability & safety (v4.3)

- Circuit breakers and degraded‚Äërun markers (in progress)
- Retries/backoff on providers/senders (in progress)
- Key rotation for Perplexity
- Strict parsing, schema enforcement, fallbacks

### Hybrid trader robustness gates (opt‚Äëin)
- ML probability gate ‚Äî blocks BUYs when model probability is below threshold or inference fails (conservative default):
  - Env: `TB_USE_ML_GATE`, `TB_ML_GATE_MODEL_PATH` (default `eval_runs/ml/latest/model.pt`), `TB_ML_FEATURES_PATH`, `TB_ML_GATE_MIN_PROB`.
- ATR volatility filter (15m) ‚Äî require ATR% within band to avoid dead or chaotic regimes:
  - Env: `TB_USE_ATR_FILTER`, `TB_ATR_LEN`, `TB_ATR_MIN_PCT`, `TB_ATR_MAX_PCT`.
- Higher‚Äëtimeframe regime alignment (1h EMA) ‚Äî trade only in direction of the HTF trend:
  - Env: `TB_USE_HTF_REGIME`, `TB_HTF_EMA_LEN` (e.g., 200).
- Heartbeat notifications ‚Äî optional liveness pings every N runs when notifications are enabled:
  - Env: `TB_TRADER_NOTIFY_HEARTBEAT`, `TB_HEARTBEAT_EVERY_N`.

- Per‚Äëtrade notional cap ‚Äî hard USD cap per order; quantity is clamped so `qty * entry_price ‚â§ cap`:
  - Env: `TB_MAX_NOTIONAL_PER_TRADE` (default `1000`).
  - Enforcement points: `calc_position_size()` and a safety‚Äënet before submit in `place_bracket()` within `scripts/hybrid_crypto_trader.py`.

  - Tape: `alpaca.py`, `price.py`, `bars_stock.py`, `timescales.py`
  - Narrative: `perplexity_fetcher.py`, `pplx_fetcher.py`, `narrative_dev.py`
  - Divergence is the explicit gap between story and price across multiple horizons.

- **Semantic relevance gating** ‚Äî only asset‚Äërelevant content is scored
  - `relevance.py`, `narrative_dev.py`

- **Robust aggregation** ‚Äî MAD outlier drop + trimmed means
  - `sentiment_utils.py`

- **Decay and timescale alignment** ‚Äî avoid stale narratives and single‚Äëwindow bias
  - `narrative_dev.py`, `timescales.py`

- **Confirmation checks (price vs narrative)** ‚Äî penalize contradictions
  - `confirmation.py`, `timescales.py`

- **Source diversity and de‚Äëduplication**
  - `dedupe_utils.py`, `diversity.py`, `source_weights.py`, `debug_sources.py`

- **Explainability & number‚Äëfree chat**
  - `scripts/evidence_lines.py`, `scripts/tg_digest_formatter.py`, `scripts/discord_formatter.py`

- **Continuous evaluation and calibration**
  - `scripts/eval_metrics.py`, `scripts/eval_runner.py`, `scripts/eval_ingest.py`

- **Operational guardrails**
  - `autocommit.py`, `.env.example` (key rotation, push gating, retries/backoff WIP)

***

## Initial data sources

- **Market data (objective)**: Alpaca bars/price
  - `alpaca.py`, `price.py`, `bars_stock.py`
- **News synthesis (structured)**: Perplexity Pro API
  - `perplexity_fetcher.py`, `pplx_fetcher.py`
- **Optional mainstream feed**: CoinDesk RSS
  - `coindesk_rss.py`
- **Prediction markets (reference)**: Polymarket via PPLX
  - `providers/polymarket_pplx.py`, `scripts/polymarket_bridge.py`

Alternative (comma-separated):

### Polymarket configuration (.env)

Polymarket discovery/mapping can be toggled and tuned via these env vars:

```
# Enable and choose source
TB_ENABLE_POLYMARKET=1
TB_POLYMARKET_SOURCE=pplx   # pplx (Perplexity-backed) recommended; native supported for tests

# Scope and caps
TB_POLYMARKET_ASSETS=BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP
TB_POLYMARKET_MAX_ITEMS=2   # bridge will cap to this; discover_and_map also accepts max_items arg

# Liquidity gating (optional; defaults off)
TB_POLYMARKET_MIN_LIQUIDITY=1000
TB_POLYMARKET_REQUIRE_LIQUIDITY=0  # set 1 to enforce liquidityUSD >= MIN

# Quality gate (if provider supplies quality/score)
TB_POLYMARKET_MIN_QUALITY=0.0

# Time window and activity
TB_POLYMARKET_MIN_WEEKS=0
TB_POLYMARKET_MAX_WEEKS=52
TB_POLYMARKET_MAX_WINDOW_DAYS=30   # additional cap used by bridge
TB_POLYMARKET_TODAY_ACTIVE_ONLY=0  # when 1, show only currently-trading markets

# Misc
TB_POLYMARKET_SHOW_EMPTY=1
TB_POLYMARKET_LIMIT=50
TB_POLYMARKET_TITLE_KEYWORDS=BTC,Bitcoin,ETH,Ethereum,SOL,Solana
TB_POLYMARKET_NUMBERS_IN_CHAT=0
TB_POLYMARKET_DEBUG=0
```

Notes:
- Native provider always enforces a sane end-date window and requires `resolutionSource`.
- PPLX provider relaxes windowing by default; the bridge applies final windowing and caps and honors liquidity gating when enabled.

#### Sender-specific flags
- `TB_POLYMARKET_PPLX_USE_PLAIN_ONLY=1` ‚Äî force only the dedicated `PPLX_API_KEY` for digest runs (no rotation).
- `TB_POLYMARKET_FALLBACK_NATIVE=1` ‚Äî allow native fallback when PPLX returns zero items.
- `TB_AUTOCOMMIT_DOCS=1` ‚Äî auto-commit/push `polymarket_digest.md` after a run (disable with `0` for dry-runs).
- `TB_NO_DISCORD=1` ‚Äî suppress Discord sends (Telegram already gated by `TB_NO_TELEGRAM`).

- Legacy sentiment_score retained; tracer uses sentiment_robust

## What's new in V1.1
- Weighted relevance by source (Perplexity > CoinDesk > Alpaca) to improve acceptance precision.
- Perplexity search recency fixed to "day" to curb stale items.
- Alpha-first console output and JSON: signal summary + playbook (no more process-heavy text).
- Telegram integration to deliver the alpha summary to a channel/group.
- DB payload alignment: summary/detail retained; additional fields for audit (relevance_details with raw/weighted and source).

# Tracer Bullet ‚Äî Crypto News-to-Alpha Agent

Tracer Bullet ingests multi-source headlines, filters for asset relevance, scores narrative vs price/volume, and outputs a trader-facing signal with next steps. Exports artifacts and can DM you via Telegram.

## What‚Äôs new (V1.1)
- Per-source weighted relevance (Perplexity > CoinDesk > Alpaca).
- Perplexity ‚Äúday‚Äù recency enforcement and provenance capture.
- Alpha-first console/JSON output (signal + playbook).
- Telegram DM integration for end-of-run push.
- Restored payload summary/detail for DB schema alignment.

## Quick start
1) Configure .env with data/API keys and Telegram (optional).
2) Install deps: `pip3 install -U python-dotenv requests`
3) Run: `python3 tracer_bullet.py` (saves to runs/, bars/, sends Telegram if configured)

## V3 Bias Immunity and Sizing

### Timescale scoring
- Adds short/mid/long horizon analysis using 1-min bars (60/180/360 min tails).
- Each horizon computes:
  - divergence_h = narrative_decayed_proxy ‚àí price_score_h
  - price_move_pct_h: abs% change first‚Üílast close in horizon
  - volume_z_h: last-bar volume z-score within horizon (0 if n<3)
- Combined divergence:
  - Weighted sum with default weights short=0.50, mid=0.35, long=0.15
  - Weights overrideable via env; renormalized to sum=1.0
- Alignment:
  - alignment_flag True if ‚â•2 horizons share the combined sign and |divergence_h| ‚â• 0.20
- Output:
  - payload.timescale_scores with per-horizon metrics, combined_divergence, aligned_horizons, alignment_flag, weights

### Negative-confirmation weighting
- Small, bounded penalties applied to confidence when confirmations contradict the narrative:
  - price_vs_narrative: notable short-term price move against combined divergence
  - volume_support: low average volume_z for sizable divergence
  - timescale_alignment: lack of alignment for sizable divergence
- Penalties sum and are clamped to a minimum (default -0.05)
- Output:
  - payload.confirmation_checks (name, passed, delta)
  - payload.confirmation_penalty (‚â§ 0), applied to confidence with floor/cap

### Position sizing (informational)
- Maps final confidence to a target risk size (R) with floors and caps
- Linear scaling between confidence floor and cap to [min_R, max_R]
- Optional volatility normalization hook (off by default)
- Output:
  - payload.position_sizing {confidence, target_R, notes[], params{...}}
- No order placement in V3; Telegram includes a one-liner when target_R > 0

### New environment variables
- Timescales weights:
  - TB_TS_W_SHORT (default 0.50)
  - TB_TS_W_MID (default 0.35)
  - TB_TS_W_LONG (default 0.15)
- Confirmation penalties:
  - TB_CONF_PRICE_VS_NARR (default -0.02)
  - TB_CONF_VOLUME_SUPPORT (default -0.01)
  - TB_CONF_TS_ALIGN (default -0.02)
  - TB_CONF_PENALTY_MIN (default -0.05)
- Sizing:
  - TB_SIZE_CONF_FLOOR (default 0.65)
  - TB_SIZE_CONF_CAP (default 0.85)
  - TB_SIZE_MIN_R (default 0.25)
  - TB_SIZE_MAX_R (default 1.00)

### Example usage
- Override timescale weights:
```
TB_TS_W_SHORT=0.6 TB_TS_W_MID=0.3 TB_TS_W_LONG=0.1 python3 scripts/run.py --symbol BTC/USD --lookback 240 --no-telegram
```
- Tune confirmation penalties:
```
TB_CONF_PRICE_VS_NARR=-0.03 TB_CONF_TS_ALIGN=-0.03 python3 scripts/run.py --symbol BTC/USD --lookback 240 --no-telegram
```
- Adjust sizing floor/caps:
```
TB_SIZE_CONF_FLOOR=0.66 TB_SIZE_MIN_R=0.30 python3 scripts/run.py --symbol BTC/USD --lookback 240 --no-telegram
```

## V3.1 Multi-Asset Universe

## Ops & Automation ‚Äî Hybrid Trader (24/7)

This project includes a fully automated hybrid crypto trader with self-healing and monitoring.

- **Start loop**: `scripts/start_hybrid_loop.sh`
  - Loads `.env`, sets conservative defaults, starts a periodic ML retrainer and the trader loop.
  - Preflight: if `config/promoted_params.json` is missing/stale (> `TB_START_MAX_PROMOTED_AGE_DAYS`, default 8), it auto-runs `scripts/weekly_propose_canary.sh` before starting.
  - Artifacts auto-commit/push (JSON/CSV/MD only; never `*.py`) controlled by `TB_AUTOCOMMIT_ARTIFACTS`, `TB_AUTOCOMMIT_PUSH`.

- **Robustness gates (env toggles)**
  - `TB_USE_ML_GATE`, `TB_ML_GATE_MODEL_PATH`, `TB_ML_GATE_MIN_PROB`
  - `TB_USE_ATR_FILTER`, `TB_ATR_LEN`, `TB_ATR_MIN_PCT`, `TB_ATR_MAX_PCT`
  - `TB_USE_HTF_REGIME`, `TB_HTF_EMA_LEN`

- **Notifications**
  - Enable via `TB_TRADER_NOTIFY=1` and channels: Discord (`TB_ENABLE_DISCORD=1`, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`), Telegram allowed unless `TB_NO_TELEGRAM=1`.
  - Heartbeats every N runs: `TB_TRADER_NOTIFY_HEARTBEAT=1`, `TB_HEARTBEAT_EVERY_N`.

- **Watchdog (cron)**
  - Every 2 minutes restarts the loop if it dies: `scripts/watchdog_hybrid.sh`  (crontab tag `# com.tracer.watchdog-hybrid`).

- **Daily health check (cron 09:00)**
  - `scripts/health_check.sh` verifies process, log freshness, recent `runs/`, and promoted params freshness.
  - Self-heal: if `promoted_params.json` is stale/missing, it runs `scripts/weekly_propose_canary.sh` once (lock-protected), then re-checks before alerting.
  - Alerts only on failure (Discord/Telegram gated by env).

- **Weekly propose+canary**
  - Primary cron Sundays 03:00; backup Wednesdays 03:00 to ensure refresh.

- **Quick ops**
  - Start live: `bash scripts/start_hybrid_loop.sh`
  - Tail logs: `tail -n 200 -f trader_loop.err` and `tail -n 200 -f trader_loop.log`
  - Processes: `ps ax | egrep 'hybrid_crypto_trader.py|ml_retrainer.py' | egrep -v egrep`

See `docs/commands.md` for concrete cron lines and stop/disable examples.
