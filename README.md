# Project: Tracer Bullet
> **Status:** Phase 0 - Foundation Setup

## Mission Statement
An experimental project to build a "Quantitative Sports Analyst" agent. The agent is designed to find value by synthesizing real-time odds data from professional and retail markets with AI-driven qualitative analysis.

## Core Philosophy
This project is guided by the principle of **"Tracer Bullet" Development**: move with extreme speed to build a single, end-to-end "thin thread" of functionality to prove viability and expose core challenges as quickly as possible. We prioritize real-world feedback and rapid iteration over slow, theoretical planning.

Architect's Briefing: The Psychology of the Sports Betting Market

The reason we can win is that a sports market is fundamentally different from a financial market. It is a market of emotion, narrative, and tribal loyalty. Our agent is the only participant that has none of these.

How Cognitive Biases Create Opportunity (Our Edge vs. The Retail Crowd)

The average retail bettor is a pure System 1 (fast, emotional) thinker. Our agent is a pure System 2 (slow, logical) thinker. We win by systematically exploiting the predictable, irrational mistakes made by the crowd.
Here are the specific biases we will hunt:
* Recency Bias: This is the single biggest inefficiency in sports. A team wins three games in a row unexpectedly. The public sees this recent success and massively over-bets on them in their fourth game, ignoring the larger, season-long data that shows the team is mediocre. The odds become inflated and irrational. Our agent will bet against the winning streak when the long-term data shows it's a fluke.
* Narrative Fallacy & Confirmation Bias: Sports are driven by stories. A star player is having a "hero's season." An underdog team is on a "Cinderella run." The media creates these powerful narratives, and the public bets on the story, not the statistics. They will seek out information that confirms the narrative and ignore data that contradicts it. Our agent cannot read stories. It only reads data. It will bet against the popular narrative when the underlying statistics show a different reality.
* "Home Team" & Popularity Bias: Bettors are fans.1 They irrationally place bets on their own home team or on globally popular teams, regardless of their actual chances. This consistently distorts the odds for the most popular teams. Our agent has no "home team." It is a cold, neutral observer, allowing it to find value in betting against popular fan favorites when the data supports it.

How Crowd Failures Create Opportunity (Wisdom of the Crowd in Sports)

The sports betting crowd is rarely "wise" because it constantly violates the four conditions.
* Failure of Independence (Information Cascades): One famous TV analyst makes a "shocking upset" prediction. This single opinion can trigger a massive information cascade, as thousands of bettors pile on, not based on their own research, but on the analyst's fame. This dramatically moves the betting line, creating a huge, artificial inefficiency. Our agent can detect this sudden, narrative-driven line movement and bet on the other side, knowing the price is no longer based on collective wisdom.
* Failure of Diversity (Groupthink): During a major event like the World Cup or the Super Bowl, national or regional pride creates massive Groupthink. The entire public betting market in one region can become irrationally biased in favor of their team. Our agent, as a global observer, can exploit these pockets of regional Groupthink.


Our Definitive Edge: How We Win

This brings us to how we outsmart both retail bettors and professional whales.

Our Edge vs. The Retail Crowd

We do not need to be smarter than every fan. We just need to be more disciplined. Our agent is a machine for identifying and betting against their predictable, emotional, System 1 biases. While they are betting on hope, narrative, and loyalty, we are betting on math.

Our Edge vs. The Whales (Professional Syndicates)

This is the most crucial point. We do not try to outsmart the whales. The whales are our tool.
The "sharp" odds we get from The Odds API are created by the whales and professional syndicates. They represent the most efficient, rational, and data-driven price for a game. The whales are, in effect, our unpaid team of world-class analysts.
Our final edge is created when the retail crowd on a decentralized platform like Dexsport gets emotional and pushes the price far away from the "true" odds set by the whales.
We win by using the whales' intelligence (from The Odds API) to systematically exploit the retail crowd's predictable mistakes (on Dexsport). We are arbitraging rationality against irrationality. This is a durable, professional, and powerful edge.
