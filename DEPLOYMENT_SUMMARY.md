## üìä Technical Implementation

### Signal Quality Calculation Framework
```python
def calculate_signal_quality(sentiment_score, price_momentum, volume_z_score, news_volume, rsi):
    """
    Calculate signal quality score from 0-10
    - Sentiment strength: 0-4 points based on absolute sentiment
    - Price momentum: 0-3 points based on price movement clarity  
    - Volume confirmation: 0-2 points based on volume Z-score
    - RSI extremes: 0-1 bonus points for oversold/overbought conditions
    """
```

### Market Regime Detection
```python
def detect_market_regime(bars):
    """
    Multi-dimensional market classification:
    - Trend: strong_bull/bull/sideways/bear/strong_bear
    - Volatility: low/normal/high/extreme
    - Volume: Integrated volume pattern analysis
    - Confidence: Classification confidence scoring
    """
```

### Conviction Scoring System
```python
def calculate_conviction_score(signal_quality, regime_alignment, volatility_score, confirmation_score):
    """
    Weighted combination for holistic trade assessment:
    - Signal Quality: 40% weight (0-4 points)
    - Regime Alignment: 30% weight (0-3 points)
    - Volatility Score: 20% weight (0-2 points)
    - Confirmation Score: 10% weight (0-1 points)
    """
```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Core enhanced signal controls
TB_USE_ENHANCED_SIGNALS=1
TB_USE_REGIME_FILTERING=1

# Quality thresholds (conservative)
