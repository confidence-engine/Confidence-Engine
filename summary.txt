Here’s a concise, end-to-end summary of everything completed for Tracer Bullet so far, from initial hardening to V2 Crowd Immunity, including code, tests, ops, and docs.

Phase V1: Hardening and Reliability
- Preflight and Health
  - scripts/preflight.py validates environment, ensures runs/ and bars/ directories exist, and optionally checks Telegram reachability.
  - CLI health entrypoint: scripts/run.py --health calls preflight health and exits.

- CLI Wrapper and Config Precedence
  - scripts/run.py provides:
    - Flags: --symbol, --lookback, --no-telegram, --debug, --health.
    - Precedence: CLI > environment (including TB_* overrides) > .env > defaults.
    - .env loading via python-dotenv (find_dotenv/usecwd).
    - Early logging setup; lazy import of tracer_bullet after env overrides.

- Logging
  - Centralized logging via logging_utils.setup_logging with ISO timestamps and DEBUG/INFO levels.

- Telegram Robustness
  - telegram_bot.py defaults to plain text parse_mode (avoids formatting rejects).
  - Message truncation at 4000 chars.
  - Clean handling of HTTP 200/400/429 and exceptions.
  - Honors TB_NO_TELEGRAM=1; logs skip at INFO.
  - Conditional appends for new V2 lines (diversity/cascade/contrarian) only when applicable.

- Artifact Retention
  - retention.py:
    - prune_directory(target_dir, keep): retains most recent N files by mtime.
    - prune_artifacts(keep): applies to runs/ and bars/.
  - tracer_bullet.py invokes prune after exports and before Telegram.
  - Controlled by TB_ARTIFACTS_KEEP (default 500).

- Tests and CI
  - Core unit tests cover:
    - Telegram formatting and error handling (includes truncation, 400/429, returns).
    - Payload schema presence.
    - Retention pruning behavior (keeps last N by mtime).
  - All tests green through latest: 18 passed in your last run.
  - GitHub Actions configured for flake8, black --check, and pytest (per docs).

Phase V2: Crowd Immunity Module
- Source Diversity Engine
  - diversity.py: compute_diversity_confidence_adjustment(accepted) -> (adjustment, meta)
    - Boost: +0.03 for 2 unique sources, +0.05 for 3+ (cap +0.05).
    - Echo penalty: −0.02 if top source share ≥0.70; −0.05 if ≥0.85.
    - Clamp net to [-0.05, +0.05].
    - Meta: {"unique", "top_source_share", "counts"}.
  - tracer_bullet.py integration:
    - Applies adjustment to payload["confidence"], capped at 0.75, floored at 0.
    - payload["source_diversity"] = {meta..., "adjustment"}.
  - Telegram: adds line like “Diversity adj: +0.03 (3 sources, top share 0.62)” when |adj| >= 0.01.
  - Tests: test_diversity.py covers 1 heavy source penalty, 2-source boost, 3+ boost, empty case; schema test ensures key exists.

- Cascade/HYPE Detector
  - cascade.py: detect_cascade(accepted, bars) -> {
      repetition_ratio, price_move_pct, max_volume_z, tag, confidence_delta
    }
    - Repetition via normalized token sets and simple Jaccard/overlap clustering.
    - price_move_pct from first→last close across run bars.
    - max_volume_z via simple z-score; small windows treated as negligible.
    - Tag rule: if repetition_ratio ≥ 0.5 AND price_move_pct < 0.3 AND max_volume_z < 0.3 → tag="HYPE_ONLY", confidence_delta=-0.03; else no tag, delta 0.
  - tracer_bullet.py integration:
    - payload["cascade_detector"] populated.
    - Applies confidence_delta with floor at 0.0.
  - Telegram: adds line like “Cascade: HYPE_ONLY (repetition 0.54, |Δp| 0.2%, VolZmax 0.1)” only when tagged.
  - Tests: test_cascade.py (high repetition/low quant → HYPE_ONLY; low repetition → none; len<2 edge case), schema presence.

- Contrarian Viewport
  - contrarian.py: decide_contrarian_viewport(narr_mag, divergence, price_move_pct) -> tag
    - Returns "POTENTIAL_CROWD_MISTAKE" if:
      - |narr_mag| ≥ 0.8
      - |divergence| < 0.3
      - |price_move_pct| < 0.2
    - Else returns "".
  - tracer_bullet.py integration:
    - Uses existing narrative magnitude (decayed), divergence from payload, and cascade price_move_pct (or computes fallback).
    - payload["contrarian_viewport"] set to tag or "".
    - No confidence/action change.
  - Telegram: appends “Contrarian viewport: POTENTIAL_CROWD_MISTAKE” only when tag present.
  - Tests: test_contrarian.py positive/negative cases; schema presence updated.

Operational State and Examples
- Typical run behavior observed:
  - Bars and headlines ingested; Accepted list trimmed to top relevance; payload saved to runs/ and tracer.db updated.
  - Confidence around 0.66 in recent runs; diversity adjustment small (+0.01 in a 2-source case); cascade often no tag when volume participation is high; contrarian tag rare by design.
  - Telegram sending robust; skipped correctly when TB_NO_TELEGRAM=1.
  - Retention pruning active after runs.

Configuration and Usage
- CLI
  - python3 scripts/run.py --symbol BTC/USD --lookback 180 --no-telegram --debug
  - python3 scripts/run.py --health
- Env overrides
  - TB_SYMBOL_OVERRIDE, TB_LOOKBACK_OVERRIDE, TB_NO_TELEGRAM, TELEGRAM_PARSE_MODE (leave empty for plain), TB_ARTIFACTS_KEEP, LOG_LEVEL.
- .env.example added with all relevant keys.

Documentation
- README.md updated: Summary, Quick Start, Run, Telegram test, Config precedence, Artifacts & Retention, V2 features, Tests & CI.
- dev_logs.md updated:
  - v1-hardening: preflight, CLI/logging, Telegram robustness, tests/CI, retention.
  - v2-crowd: diversity, cascade, contrarian features and payload fields.
- RUNBOOK.md: health, routine runs, debug, overrides, artifacts, Telegram, troubleshooting.
- CONTRIBUTING.md: env and secrets, lint/test before PR, design guidelines.
- docs/payload.md: schema and V2 additions with example.

Testing Status
- Full suite passing: latest report shows 18 tests passed.
- Manual runs confirm:
  - Diversity adjustment and caps behave correctly.
  - Cascade HYPE_ONLY triggers only under high repetition + low move/vol; synthetic harness validated.
  - Contrarian tag shows only under strict conditions.

If you want, I can generate a compact executive summary (1–2 paragraphs) or a PR/release note snippet that you can paste into dev_logs.md or GitHub Releases.
