# Code of Conduct

We are building a research tool together. Be respectful, constructive, and honest.

- Be kind and inclusive. Assume good intent.
- No harassment, personal attacks, or hate speech.
- Keep discussions technical. Share evidence, not ad hominem.
- Respect privacy. Do not share secrets, tokens, or personal data.
- Follow provider ToS (Alpaca, Perplexity, Discord/Telegram) at all times.

Reporting
- If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, email the maintainers privately or open a confidential issue per `SECURITY.md`.

Enforcement
- Maintainers may warn, edit, or remove content; repeat or severe violations may lead to temporary or permanent bans from participation.
