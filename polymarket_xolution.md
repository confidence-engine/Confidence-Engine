Yes, it’s possible in principle—and it can slot cleanly into the Tracer Bullet architecture—but there are a few moving parts and caveats to handle. Here’s how to approach it end to end.

What “live crypto market in Polymarket” means for us
- Target: Crypto-related prediction markets on Polymarket (e.g., “BTC above X by date,” “ETH event outcomes,” ETF approvals, macro that impacts crypto).
- Data we need: Live market list, per-market outcomes, current prices (implied probabilities), order book or last trade (optional), resolution criteria, end times.
- Goal: Use Tracer Bullet’s alpha signals (narrative vs price/volume + crowd/bias immunity) to:
  - Prioritize which markets are mispriced or reactive.
  - Map our directional/binary thesis into a market-side “yes/no” stance.
  - Translate market odds ↔ our internal qualitative confidence to produce a spread/delta, and an action suggestion.
  - Optionally compute Kelly-lite sizing guidance based on edge band, but keep number-free in the human digest.

Integration plan (minimal changes to TB core)
- New adapter: polymarket_adapter.py
  - Fetch: list active markets (filter crypto-relevant), outcomes, current implied probabilities, close times, resolution sources.
  - Normalize: produce a consistent schema: {market_id, question, outcomes[{name, prob}], liquidity proxies (if available), end_time, tags (crypto)}.
  - Safety: timeouts, retries/backoff, cache TTL; resolve malformed/paused markets conservatively.
- Mapping TB alpha → market stance
  - If TB has a directional crypto bias (e.g., BTC constructive vs cautious), pick markets aligned with that thesis (e.g., “BTC above [threshold] by [date]” or “ETH event by [deadline]”).
  - For news/event markets (ETF decisions, hard forks), use TB’s crowd-immunity and hype tags to downgrade hype-prone setups even if odds look juicy.
  - Produce a qualitative stance per market: engage/stalk/stand aside with readiness Now/Near/Later.
- Confidence-from-odds (non-numeric digest, numeric internal)
  - Internally: Convert market price to implied probability p_mkt.
  - Map TB’s qualitative conviction (strong/moderate/low) to an internal p_TB range (not printed).
  - Edge band: compare p_TB vs p_mkt to classify edge: None / Small / Medium / Large.
  - Human digest: Do NOT print numbers; express as “odds look stretched vs our read,” “roughly in line,” or “market is discounting more than our view.”
- Sizing and action
  - If edge band ≥ Medium and TB quality is “broad” with “strong/mixed” alignment, Action=Engage; else Stalk or Stand Aside.
  - Sizing bands: Low/Medium/High tied to TB risk band; never expose numeric Kelly, keep to bands.
- Output surfaces
  - Add “Polymarket (crypto)” section to the human digest after BTC/ETH and before equities:
    - 1–3 markets with one-liners: bias, readiness, action.
    - A short rationale in plain English (“market pricing looks hype-led vs our read,” “story and structure rhyme; odds still lag,” etc.).
  - Optional: a separate Telegram channel for Polymarket if signal volume grows.

Caveats and guardrails
- Market selection: Many markets are ambiguous or resolution-dependent; prefer clearly defined, liquid markets with well-specified resolution sources and near-/mid-dated deadlines.
- Latency and microstructure: Prediction market pricing can be thin; don’t assume frictionless execution or instant arb to spot odds.
- Data quality: Treat paused, deprecated, or low-liquidity markets as “stand aside”; enforce a minimum quality filter.
- Compliance: Ensure any integration respects terms of service and local regulations; this is research/advisory output, not execution.

Where this lands in our roadmap
- Fits under v3.3 (Full crypto alt coverage + evidence lines) as an optional “prediction-market viewport” that translates crypto alpha into yes/no market stances.
- Reliability polish in v3.2 should come first (retries/backoff, self-checks), then add Polymarket adapter with conservative defaults.
- 24/7 scheduled polling for Polymarket would remain a v6 concern; until then, include it in manual/universe runs.

Minimal implementation steps (no breaking changes)
- Build polymarket_adapter.py with:
  - list_markets(filter=“crypto”) → normalized markets
  - get_market_details(market_id) → outcomes + current prices
- Add a mapper polymarket_bridge.py:
  - map_tb_alpha_to_market(tb_summary, market) → {stance, readiness, action, rationale, risk_band}
- Update digest formatter:
  - If any markets pass filters, append “Polymarket (crypto)” with 1–3 one-liners, number-free.
- Add env toggles:
  - TB_ENABLE_POLYMARKET=1
  - TB_POLYMARKET_MIN_QUALITY=basic flag (e.g., min-liquidity proxy, defined resolution source)
  - TB_POLYMARKET_MAX_ITEMS=3

Example digest one-liners (number-free, crypto-first tone)
- BTC above deadline: Stalk — Odds feel a touch hype-led vs our read; wait for stronger participation or cleaner reclaim before engaging.
- ETH event resolution: Engage — Story, structure, and tape rhyme; market still discounts the constructive skew in our read.
- BTC pullback outcome: Stand aside — Timeframes disagree and quality feels mixed; let the tape choose a side first.

Bottom line
- Yes, it’s feasible to ingest Polymarket crypto markets, compare their odds to our TB qualitative view, and produce an action + confidence band (expressed without numbers) in the human digest.
- Start with a conservative, read-only viewport and fold it into v3.3 after v3.2 reliability improves; leave continuous scheduling to v6.
