## ✅ September 3, 2025: Enhanced Signal Intelligence System Implementation

### 🧠 Major Enhancement: Unified Signal Intelligence
- ✅ **Enhanced Signal System**: Both agents now use unified signal quality intelligence
- ✅ **Signal Quality Scoring**: 0-10 scale assessment replacing ML complexity
- ✅ **Market Regime Detection**: Multi-dimensional market classification system
- ✅ **Conviction Scoring**: Weighted factor combination for holistic trade assessment
- ✅ **ML Dependency Removed**: Enhanced signals replace ML complexity with robust analysis
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing completed, both agents operational

### 🎯 Signal Intelligence Features

#### Core Signal Quality Assessment
```python
# Signal Quality Factors (0-10 scale)
- Sentiment Strength: 0-4 points (based on absolute sentiment)
- Price Momentum: 0-3 points (price movement clarity)
- Volume Confirmation: 0-2 points (volume Z-score)
- RSI Extremes: 0-1 points (oversold/overbought bonus)
```

#### Market Regime Detection
```python
# Trend Classification
- strong_bull / bull / sideways / bear / strong_bear

# Volatility Classification  
- low / normal / high / extreme

# Regime-Specific Trading Logic
- Ranging markets: Quality ≥ 6.0 required
- Bull markets: Quality ≥ 4.0 acceptable  
- Bear markets: Quality ≥ 7.0 required
```

#### Conviction Scoring System
```python
# Weighted Combination (0-10 scale)
- Signal Quality: 40% weight
- Regime Alignment: 30% weight
- Volatility Score: 20% weight
- Confirmation Score: 10% weight
```

### 🔧 Implementation Details
