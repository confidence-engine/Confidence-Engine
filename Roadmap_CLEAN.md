## 2) Milestones & DoD (Historical + Current)

### V1 â€” Confidence Engine (single-asset loop) [âœ… DONE]
- Scope: BTCUSD; Alpaca bars; narrative ingest; FinBERT+LLM polarity; divergence; Telegram preview; SQLite logging.
- DoD: end-to-end decision preview; safe parser rejections; traceable messages.

### V2 â€” Better Signals (decay, novelty, explainability) [âœ… DONE]
- Scope: event-driven triggers; decay; novelty weighting; 10â€“20 symbols; explainable messages.
- DoD: fewer, higher-quality signals; no duplicate triggers within cooldown.

### V3 â€” Bias Immunity + Sizing [âœ… DONE]
- Scope: confirmation and alignment checks; participation; volatility-aware sizing; caps/floors.
- DoD: improved precision; sizing bounded; readable rationale.

### V3.1 â€” Multiâ€‘Asset Foundations [DONE]
- Scope: crypto+stocks; trading hours; orchestrator; universe digest.
- DoD: stable multiâ€‘asset runs; digest compiles; ranked topâ€‘N.

### V3.3 â€” Evidence Lines + Polymarket (readâ€‘only) [DONE]
- Scope: numberâ€‘free evidence lines in chat; artifacts keep numbers; PPLX-only Polymarket discovery; internal_prob side-by-side.
- DoD: digest shows alts + evidence; Polymarket section present when quality met.
 - Chat label note: perâ€‘timeframe explanation line is labeled "Outcome" in chat (previously shown as "Why"). Telegram and Discord formatters are updated in lockstep to maintain parity.

### V3.4 â€” Evaluation Pipeline (Polymarket + System) [IN PROGRESS]
- Scope: `scripts/eval_metrics.py`, `eval_runner.py`, `eval_ingest.py`, `eval_weekly.py`; outputs in `eval_runs/<ts>/`.
- Metrics: Brier, logâ€‘loss, calibration bins CSV, cohort winâ€‘rates.
- DoD: â‰¥50 resolved obs; reproducible metrics; weekly snapshots; optional plots.

### V4.2 â€” Backtesting & Governance [NEXT]
- Scope: eventâ€‘ordered replay; pointâ€‘inâ€‘time features; walkâ€‘forward; cohort analytics; governance.
- DoD: leakâ€‘free; thresholds documented from OOS; cohort report produced.

### V4.3 â€” Reliability Ops Hardening [IN PROGRESS]
- Scope: retries/backoff, timeouts, schema/digest selfâ€‘checks, degraded markers, circuit breakers; git autoâ€‘push polish.
- DoD: 3â€‘day burnâ€‘in; <1% degraded; zero crashes; clear logs.

### V5 â€” 24/7 Cloud Agent [LATER]
- Scope: scheduled GH Actions cadence; secrets; monitoring/rollback; include Polymarket if stable.
- DoD: multiâ€‘week stable schedule; safe pause/rollback.

### V6 â€” Paper Execution & Risk Controls [LATER]
- Scope: dryâ€‘run execution sim; portfolio caps; perâ€‘asset limits; killâ€‘switches.
- DoD: stable dryâ€‘run; guardrails verified.

### V7 â€” Live Capital (Small, Guarded) [LATER]
- Scope: tiny notional; strict loss limits; anomaly alerts; rollback rehearsed; Polymarket exec only if â‰¥6mo strong eval.
- DoD: safe, audited trial; incident drills passed.

## 3) Crossâ€‘Cutting Workstreams (Ongoing)
- Docs: keep README/roadmap/runbook/schema digest spec current.
- Observability: metrics per run; weekly eval outputs; degraded markers.
- Safety: schema versioning; graceful degradation; provider circuit breakers; key rotation.
- Governance: version tags in artifacts; monthly param review; quarterly regime assessments.

---

## 4) Metrics & Acceptance (global)
- Reliability: crashâ€‘free runs; <1% degraded; retried tasks succeed within N attempts.
- Quality: improving Brier/logâ€‘loss; calibration residuals centered; cohort winâ€‘rates stable.
- Ops: autoâ€‘commit/push success rates; zero lingering untracked artifacts.
- Delivery: digest send success (when enabled); no oversized message failures (splitter).

---

## 5) Operating Cadence
- Daily: agent runs; dev logs updated; triage errors; light wiki edits.
- Weekly: review signals/cohorts; run `eval_weekly.py`; snapshot metrics.
- Monthly: governance; walkâ€‘forward update; universe refresh.
- Quarterly: regime analysis; scale/retire cohorts; source/tactics research.

---

## 6) Dependencies & Artefacts
- Providers: Alpaca market data; PPLX (Perplexity) for structured news; Polymarket via PPLX.
- Artefacts: `universe_runs/`, `runs/`, `eval_runs/`, enriched JSON/CSV with evidence lines and polymarket arrays.
- Git Ops: `autocommit.py`; `TB_*_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT`, `TB_*_GIT_PUSH`, include data flags.

---

## 7) Risks & Mitigations
- Provider outages â†’ retries/backoff, key rotation, degradedâ€‘run markers.
- Schema drift â†’ strict validators; explicit versioning; repairâ€‘thenâ€‘reject.
- Overfitting in backtests â†’ pointâ€‘inâ€‘time features; walkâ€‘forward IS/OOS; governance cadence.
- Artifact bloat â†’ pruning/rotation or archival strategy (later).

---

## 8) Immediate Next Actions
1. Finish v4.3 selfâ€‘checks + retries/backoff + autoâ€‘push polish.
2. Accumulate resolved observations; ship optional calibration plots.
3. Outline backtesting harness interfaces; define pointâ€‘inâ€‘time feature extracts.
