## Core Strategy: Hybrid Intelligence

Our agent's "edge" comes from a hybrid model that synthesizes two distinct types of intelligence:

1.  **The Quantitative Engine (The "Ground Truth"):** We use a professional, reliable API (Alpaca) to get clean, structured, machine-readable data (price, volume). This represents the "sharp" consensus of the professional market.
2.  **The Qualitative Engine (The "Narrative"):** We use a powerful AI research agent (the Perplexity API) to get rich, synthesized, contextual information, including news, sentiment, and other narrative factors that numbers alone cannot capture.

Our alpha is generated by identifying **divergences** between these two pillars.
