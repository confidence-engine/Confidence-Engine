# The Confidence Engine: Knowledge Wiki

This document contains the core strategic and technical knowledge for the project.

## Core Strategy: Hybrid Intelligence

Our agent's "edge" comes from a hybrid model that synthesizes two distinct types of intelligence:

1.  **The Quantitative Engine (The "Ground Truth"):** We use a professional, reliable sports odds API to get clean, structured, machine-readable data. This represents the "sharp" consensus of the professional betting market.
2.  **The Qualitative Engine (The "Narrative"):** We use a powerful AI research agent (the Perplexity API) to get rich, synthesized, contextual information, including news, sentiment, and other narrative factors that numbers alone cannot capture.

Our alpha is generated by identifying **divergences** between these two pillars.

## Architectural Principles

-   **Tracer Bullet Development:** We prioritize speed and real-world feedback. Our first goal is to build a single, end-to-end "thin thread" of functionality to prove viability before refactoring into a professional, modular system.
-   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Every component will be built with a "test-first" approach to guarantee correctness and reliability.
-   **No Compromise:** We will always choose the best, most robust solution and will not simplify for the sake of convenience if it impacts the quality of the final agent.
-   **Separation of Code & Config:** All static knowledge (API keys, URLs, credibility scores) will be kept in configuration files (`.env`, `config.json`), separate from the agent's operational logic (`.py` files).
