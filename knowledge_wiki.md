# Roadmap (Milestone-Based) — Project Tracer Bullet

A living, milestone-driven plan from V1 tracer bullet to small live capital, emphasizing reliability, explainability, and leak-free validation.

Last updated: 2025-08-14.

---

## Ops & Reliability — Recent Findings (v3.1.6–v3.1.7)

- **Post-enrichment auto-commit/push**
  - After `scripts/tracer_bullet_universe.py` calls `enrich_artifact()` (injects `evidence_line` and `polymarket` array into the saved universe JSON), the file changes are now automatically staged, committed, and pushed when:
    - `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=1` and optionally `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_PUSH=1`.
  - Prevents the enriched universe JSON from lingering as modified in your working tree.

- **Discord gating strictly enforced**
  - `TB_NO_DISCORD=1` now prevents any Discord sends even if webhook is configured.
  - Send conditions in `scripts/tracer_bullet_universe.py`:
    - Telegram: requires `TB_NO_TELEGRAM=0` and TG creds.
    - Discord: requires `TB_NO_DISCORD=0`, `TB_ENABLE_DISCORD=1`, and webhook.

- **Auto-commit/push defaults**
  - `scripts/scan_universe.py` already commits and pushes artifacts by default:
    - `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=1` (default)
    - `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_PUSH=1` (default)
  - `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_PUSH_DEFAULT=1` can force push if push was unset.

- **Safe-run profile**
  - For dry runs without external sends, set: `TB_NO_TELEGRAM=1`, `TB_NO_DISCORD=1`.
  - Artifacts will still be committed/pushed if AUTOCOMMIT/PUSH are on.

---

## Artifact Schema Enrichment (Universe)

- The saved universe JSON is enriched with:
  - Per-asset `evidence_line` (full narrative string; artifacts retain numbers, chat output strips numbers).
  - Top-level `polymarket` array with mapped markets and numeric fields (probabilities, liquidity, dates, etc.).
- `metrics.csv` includes `evidence_line` when present.
- Backward compatibility preserved; tests validate enrichment and legacy loading.

---

## Digest Delivery Rules (Telegram/Discord)

- Telegram human digest (optional):
  - Respects `TB_HUMAN_DIGEST` and `TB_NO_TELEGRAM`.
  - Auto-splits long messages to fit Telegram limits (preserving order/content).
  - Supports crypto-only mode via `TB_DIGEST_TELEGRAM_CRYPTO_ONLY=1`.
  - Surfaces BTC/ETH + top-K alts controlled by `TB_DIGEST_TOP_ALTS` (`ALL` or `-1` includes all).

- Discord full digest:
  - All sections/assets rendered as embeds with chunking as needed.
  - Respects `TB_NO_DISCORD`, `TB_ENABLE_DISCORD`, and webhook presence.

---

## Polymarket (PPLX) Provider — Key Notes

- Source is strictly Perplexity Pro API (`pplx`); native code removed for prod path.
- Enforces model `sonar` and strict JSON extraction (first balanced array fallback).
- API key rotation supported: `PPLX_API_KEY_1..N`, then `PPLX_API_KEY`.
- Filters and flags:
  - `TB_POLYMARKET_ASSETS`, `TB_POLYMARKET_LIMIT`, `TB_POLYMARKET_TODAY_ACTIVE_ONLY`,
    `TB_POLYMARKET_REQUIRE_LIQUIDITY`, `TB_POLYMARKET_MIN_LIQUIDITY`,
    `TB_POLYMARKET_TITLE_KEYWORDS`, `TB_POLYMARKET_SHOW_EMPTY`.
- Bridge caps via `TB_POLYMARKET_MAX_ITEMS` and enforces sort/limit before return.
- Internal probability estimator included; calibration uses alignment, participation, readiness, signal strength.
- Debugging with `TB_POLYMARKET_DEBUG=1` prints prompt/key/attempt/choices and calibration components.

---

## Environment Flags — Quick Reference

- Sending
  - `TB_HUMAN_DIGEST=1` — enable human digest rendering
  - `TB_NO_TELEGRAM=0` — allow Telegram (requires creds)
  - `TB_NO_DISCORD=0`, `TB_ENABLE_DISCORD=1` — allow Discord (requires webhook)

- Digest surfacing
  - `TB_DIGEST_TOP_ALTS=ALL` | `-1` | `K`
  - `TB_DIGEST_TELEGRAM_CRYPTO_ONLY=1`
  - `TB_DIGEST_EXPLAIN_HIGH_RISK_ACTION=1`

- Universe artifacts
  - `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=1`, `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_PUSH=1`, `TB_UNIVERSE_GIT_PUSH_DEFAULT=0/1`

- Polymarket PPLX
  - `TB_ENABLE_POLYMARKET=1`, `TB_POLYMARKET_SOURCE=pplx`
  - `TB_POLYMARKET_MAX_ITEMS`, `TB_POLYMARKET_LIMIT`, `TB_POLYMARKET_TODAY_ACTIVE_ONLY`
  - `TB_POLYMARKET_REQUIRE_LIQUIDITY`, `TB_POLYMARKET_MIN_LIQUIDITY`
  - `TB_POLYMARKET_DEBUG`, `TB_POLYMARKET_PPLX_RETRIES`, `TB_POLYMARKET_PPLX_PROMPT`

---

## Git: Verify Local vs Remote Sync

Run inside repo:

```
git fetch origin
git status -sb     # shows ahead/behind vs origin/main
git rev-parse HEAD && git rev-parse origin/main
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD -n 10    # local-only commits
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main -n 10    # remote-only commits
```

In sync when:
- `HEAD` hash equals `origin/main` hash
- `git status -sb` shows no `[ahead/behind]`
- Both `git log` ranges above print nothing

---

## Guiding Objectives

- Ship an end-to-end tracer quickly, then harden.
- Keep features interpretable; earn complexity with evidence.
- Capture rich evidence per signal to build our proprietary dataset.
- Validate via event-ordered, leak-free backtests before scaling.

***

## V1 — Tracer Bullet (single-asset, end-to-end)

Goal: One clean loop from ingest → analyze → decide → log → notify, with optional paper order.

Scope:
- Single symbol: BTCUSD.
- Data: Alpaca bars(last 60–120m) + latest headlines.
- Narrative: dev adapter returns strict JSON; schema-validated; raw JSON stored.
- NLP: FinBERT headline sentiment blended with LLM polarity; exponential time decay.
- TA: RSI(14), MA(10 vs. 50) slope, MACD histogram, volume z-score → Price Score.
- Divergence: z(Narrative) − z(Price); thresholds gate entries (long-only).
- Execution: Alpaca paper order (market), idempotent client order IDs.
- Logging: SQLite signals, trades, prompts; store raw narrative JSON.
- Notifications: Telegram “style analysis” message per signal (human-readable rationale).

Acceptance criteria:
- End-to-end run produces at least one decision preview and, when enabled, a paper trade with full context logged.
- Narrative JSON parser rejects malformed payloads safely (no trade on invalid parse).
- Telegram messages include summary, scores, divergence, TA context, decision, and trace IDs.

Out-of-scope:
- Shorts; novelty weighting; backtesting harness.

Why now:
- Establishes the thin thread; surfaces integration risks immediately.

***

## V2 — Better Signals (event triggers, decay, explainability)

Goal: Reduce noise and improve precision; expand to a curated multi-asset set.

Scope:
- Event-driven scans: trigger focused scans on headline deltas (novelty/first-seen shifts).
- Narrative decay active (configurable half-life).
- Basic novelty weighting: de-duplicate echoes; boost first-source items.
- Universe: 10–20 narrative-sensitive symbols (news-dense equities + selective crypto).
- Explainability+: enrich Telegram + DB with anchor headlines, entities, and reason codes.

Acceptance criteria:
- Fewer, higher-quality signals per day; explainability artifacts stored for each signal.
- No duplicate triggers for the same story within a cooldown window.
- Stable event loop under typical data loads.

Out-of-scope:
- Backtesting; parameter governance.

Why now:
- Aligns signal timing with information flow; improves trust and review efficiency.

***

## V3 — Backtesting & Parameter Governance (leak-free)

Goal: Prove the edge with event-ordered replay and set disciplined parameter update cadence.

Scope:
- Event-ordered backtester: replay timestamped bars + headlines; compute features point-in-time only; evaluate forward returns (e.g., 15m/60m).
- Walk-forward validation: rolling windows for tuning/validation; prevent regime overfit.
- Parameter governance: small set of tunables (divergence T, confidence C, decay half-life H, TA weights) with monthly review/update cadence.
- Cohort analytics: performance by asset, time-of-day, volatility regime, event type.

Acceptance criteria:
- Reproducible backtest runs with documented in-sample/out-of-sample splits.
- Published thresholds from out-of-sample results.
- Cohort report identifying where edge concentrates.

Out-of-scope:
- Execution microstructure tweaks; live capital.

Why now:
- Converts plausible signals into evidence-backed settings; guards against hidden look-ahead.

***

## V4 — Execution Quality & Microstructure

Goal: Improve realized PnL by reducing slippage and avoiding thin/hostile microstructure.

Scope:
- Order tactics: prefer market in normal spreads; switch to limit or small slices when spreads widen or volatility spikes.
- Position sizing: scale notional by volatility and confidence; enforce max per-symbol and total risk caps.
- Cooldowns: stricter symbol/story-level cooldowns to avoid clustering.

Acceptance criteria:
- Measurable reduction in slippage vs. V3 baseline on paper.
- Fewer clustered entries around the same narrative burst.
- No increase in failure-to-fill beyond acceptable bounds.

Out-of-scope:
- Options overlays; streaming infra.

Why now:
- Good signals can still lose with poor fills; execution quality compounds returns.

***

## V5 — Data Breadth & Explainability+

Goal: Strengthen narrative signal; make audit and postmortems faster.

Scope:
- Optional crowd/attention proxy: carefully filtered social signals as secondary evidence (never primary gate).
- Source credibility learning: adapt weights for sources with consistent predictive value.
- Case file per signal: compact artifact bundling summary, quotes, entities, scores, divergence, and outcome link.

Acceptance criteria:
- Higher precision without a surge in false positives.
- Each trade explainable via a single, human-readable case file.

Out-of-scope:
- Automated model selection; deep learning expansions.

Why now:
- Layered evidence improves robustness and speeds iteration.

***

## V6 — Small Live Capital, Monitoring, and Safety

Goal: Move beyond paper with strict guardrails and observability.

Scope:
- Live deployment (small size): daily loss limits, per-trade caps, and circuit breakers (halt on repeated failures).
- Monitoring: hourly heartbeats, daily summaries, anomaly alerts (e.g., sudden silence in a usually noisy symbol).
- Versioning: tag every signal/trade with code/prompt/params version.

Acceptance criteria:
- Stable live operation for a defined trial period (e.g., 4–6 weeks) with automatic rollback path.
- Full reproducibility of any live decision.

Out-of-scope:
- Aggressive scaling; options strategies.

Why now:
- Real-world frictions manifest only with live orders; start small and safe.

***

## V7 — Regime Adaptation & Selective Automation

Goal: Scale where edge persists; adapt weights by simple regimes.

Scope:
- Regime-aware reweighting: small, interpretable set of regimes (e.g., volatility buckets, time-of-day) that adjust TA/narrative weights or thresholds.
- Selective automation: fully automate cohorts with robust edge; keep others alert-only or at reduced size.
- Quarterly research loop: refresh asset list, revalidate parameters, and retire decayed cohorts.

Acceptance criteria:
- Consistent performance across regimes with limited parameter drift.
- Documented decisions to scale or de-scale specific cohorts.

Out-of-scope:
- Ultra-low-latency infra unless justified by measured benefit.

Why now:
- Sustain performance as conditions change; scale responsibly.

***

## Cross-Cutting Workstreams

- Reliability & Resilience (all versions)
  - Strict JSON schemas; repair-then-reject for narrative; never trade on invalid parses.
  - Perplexity key rotation; retries with exponential backoff; timeouts; circuit breakers.
  - TA-only degradation mode when narrative is unavailable; safe halts on data failures.
  - APScheduler-based orchestration for interval/cron/event jobs[1][2][3].

- Documentation & Evidence (continuous)
  - Wiki: architecture, data contracts, prompts, test matrix, runbooks, decisions.
  - Dev log: daily entries of changes, issues, next steps.
  - Version tags baked into signals/trades for reproducibility.

- Compliance & Safety (V6+)
  - Environment separation; secrets in .env; logging hygiene; clear rollback procedures.

***

## Milestone Checklists

***

## Risks and Mitigations (snapshot)

- Narrative parser fragility → strict schema, repair-then-reject, curated test corpus.
- API rate limits/outages → key rotation, backoff, TA-only mode, circuit breakers.
- Look-ahead bias → event-ordered replay, lagged features, walk-forward validation.
- Overfitting/indicator bloat → small, interpretable feature set; robustness checks; governance cadence.
- Execution slippage → microstructure-aware order rules; measure impact before adding complexity.

***

## Operating Cadence

- Daily: run agent; update dev log at EOD; triage any errors; light wiki edits for new learnings.
- Weekly: review signals and cohort metrics; adjust backlog; curate wiki Decisions.
- Monthly: parameter governance meeting; walk-forward update; asset universe refresh.
- Quarterly: regime analysis; scale/retire cohorts; research new sources or tactics.

- dedupe_utils.py
  - Normalize + dedupe titles; preserves original text.

- provenance.py
  - Tag origins for accepted headlines: perplexity, alpaca, coindesk, unknown.

- narrative_analysis_extras.py
  - adaptive_trigger: adjust divergence trigger by volume Z; clamp to [0.6, 1.5].

- export.py
  - export_run_json: runs/<id>.json
  - save_bars_csv: bars/<id>.csv
  - save_accepted_txt: runs/<id>_accepted.txt with [source] relevance | headline

- config.py
  - .env loader and settings.
  - Supports PPLX_API_KEY_1..N or PPLX_API_KEYS (comma) or single PPLX_API_KEY.
  - Toggles: USE_COINDESK, PPLX_ENABLED; thresholds, lookbacks.

- debug_sources.py
  - Dev utility: print counts/samples from Alpaca, Perplexity (rotation), CoinDesk.

- test_pplx_auth.py
  - Dev utility: 200/401 checks for each Perplexity key.

-----------------
# How it works

## Data ingestion
- Alpaca latest_headlines(symbol, limit)
- Perplexity Pro API via sonar-pro with key rotation (PPLX_API_KEY_1..N or PPLX_API_KEYS)
- CoinDesk RSS (USE_COINDESK toggle)
- Deduplication across sources

## Relevance gating
- Semantic similarity to enriched BTC topic
- RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD 0.40–0.45
- Keyword fallback if 0 accepted

## Sentiment + narrative
- FinBERT robust sentiment (relevant-only): MAD outlier drop + 10% trimmed mean
- Narrative from accepted headlines; confidence by count; composite signal blends LLM (neutral baseline) and FinBERT; decay by staleness

## Price/volume and divergence
- Price score from bars; Volume Z
- Divergence = decayed narrative − price score
- Adaptive trigger based on volume (lower when high participation, higher when low)

## Decision and outputs
- BUY/HOLD with confidence cutoff, divergence trigger, volume floor
- Exports JSON, accepted TXT, bars CSV; auto-commit
- Console preview: provenance, top-5 relevance (debug), beginner-friendly summary

--------------------------

# Runbook – daily use

## Pre-run
- Ensure .env has Perplexity keys (PPLX_API_KEY_1..N or PPLX_API_KEYS) and PPLX_ENABLED=true
- USE_COINDESK=true recommended
- Start with RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD=0.42

## Run
- python3 tracer_bullet.py

## Validate
- Console shows:
  - Accepted (source, score) with ~3–8 items
  - Decision Preview with adaptive trigger and robust FinBERT kept/dropped
- Artifacts:
  - runs/<id>.json
  - runs/<id>_accepted.txt
  - bars/<id>.csv
- Auto-commit pushes runs/ and bars/

## Tuning
- If accepted < 2 repeatedly:
  - Set RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD=0.40
  - Check [Relevance top-5] output
- Verify Perplexity returns titles (debug_sources.py) and keys 200 (test_pplx_auth.py)

## Per-source weighting and Perplexity recency

- Weighted relevance:
  - Each headline’s semantic relevance is multiplied by a source weight:
    - Perplexity: 1.10
    - CoinDesk: 1.05
    - Alpaca: 1.00
  - JSON payload -> relevance_details.accepted[].raw_relevance and weighted_relevance
- Perplexity recency:
  - web_search_options.search_recency_filter = "day" (past 24h)
  - Ensures fresher results and reduces stale headlines

## Telegram integration
- Set .env:
  - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
  - TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...
  - TELEGRAM_PARSE_MODE=Markdown (or HTML)
- Run:
  - python3 tracer_bullet.py (auto-sends at end)
  - or python3 export_to_telegram.py (send latest run)
- Evidence in message:
  - Top-3 accepted headlines by weighted relevance with sources
  - Alpha summary and next steps

## Outputs
- Alpha-first:
  - alpha_summary: narrative vs price gap, confidence, volume tone, one-line signal label
  - alpha_next_steps: actionable playbook (entry gating, alerts, risk, invalidation)
- Evidence:
  - relevance_details (accepted/rejected): headline, raw_relevance, weighted_relevance, source
  - pplx_provenance: Perplexity items (title/source/url)
- Artifacts:
  - runs/<id>.json, runs/<id>_accepted.txt (source + weighted relevance), bars/<id>.csv
- Delivery:
  - Console + Telegram push
## Perplexity recency
- pplx_fetcher sets web_search_options.search_recency_filter="day"
- Adjust hours via PPLX_HOURS in .env for prompt time hint; recency filter remains "day"

- narrative_dev.py
  - filter_relevant_weighted: returns accepted/rejected with (headline, raw_score, weighted_score, source)
- pplx_fetcher.py
  - Enforces recency="day"; returns titles + items (title, source, url)
- alpha_summary.py
  - Trader-facing alpha_summary and alpha_next_steps for console/Telegram/JSON
- telegram_bot.py / export_to_telegram.py
  - Bot wrapper and latest-run sender

# Runbook

## Regular run
- Run: `python3 tracer_bullet.py`
- Artifacts:
  - runs/<id>.json (full payload incl. alpha_* and relevance_details)
  - runs/<id>_accepted.txt (source + weighted relevance + headline)
  - bars/<id>.csv (recent bars snapshot)

## Telegram DM (optional)
- .env:
  - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
  - TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=... (numeric DM id; negative for groups/channels)
  - TELEGRAM_PARSE_MODE=Markdown (or HTML)
- End-of-run push is automatic (integrated in tracer_bullet.py).
- Send latest run manually: `python3 export_to_telegram.py`

## Troubleshooting
- If getUpdates returns empty, send “hi” to the bot and retry.
- If posting to a channel, bot must be Admin.

# Configuration Guide

## Relevance
- Threshold: settings.relevance_threshold (weighted score threshold).
- Per-source weights (default):
  - perplexity: 1.10
  - coindesk: 1.05
  - alpaca: 1.00

## Perplexity
- Day recency enforced in pplx_fetcher (web_search_options.search_recency_filter="day").
- Multiple API keys supported for rotation.

## Telegram
- TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN from BotFather.
- TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID (numeric):
  - DM: positive id from getUpdates.
  - Group/Channel: negative id (often -100...).
