# Roadmap (Milestone-Based) — Project Tracer Bullet

A living, milestone-driven plan from V1 tracer bullet to small live capital, emphasizing reliability, explainability, and leak-free validation.

Last updated: 2025-08-08.

## Guiding Objectives

- Ship an end-to-end tracer quickly, then harden.
- Keep features interpretable; earn complexity with evidence.
- Capture rich evidence per signal to build our proprietary dataset.
- Validate via event-ordered, leak-free backtests before scaling.

***

## V1 — Tracer Bullet (single-asset, end-to-end)

Goal: One clean loop from ingest → analyze → decide → log → notify, with optional paper order.

Scope:
- Single symbol: BTCUSD.
- Data: Alpaca bars(last 60–120m) + latest headlines.
- Narrative: dev adapter returns strict JSON; schema-validated; raw JSON stored.
- NLP: FinBERT headline sentiment blended with LLM polarity; exponential time decay.
- TA: RSI(14), MA(10 vs. 50) slope, MACD histogram, volume z-score → Price Score.
- Divergence: z(Narrative) − z(Price); thresholds gate entries (long-only).
- Execution: Alpaca paper order (market), idempotent client order IDs.
- Logging: SQLite signals, trades, prompts; store raw narrative JSON.
- Notifications: Telegram “style analysis” message per signal (human-readable rationale).

Acceptance criteria:
- End-to-end run produces at least one decision preview and, when enabled, a paper trade with full context logged.
- Narrative JSON parser rejects malformed payloads safely (no trade on invalid parse).
- Telegram messages include summary, scores, divergence, TA context, decision, and trace IDs.

Out-of-scope:
- Shorts; novelty weighting; backtesting harness.

Why now:
- Establishes the thin thread; surfaces integration risks immediately.

***

## V2 — Better Signals (event triggers, decay, explainability)

Goal: Reduce noise and improve precision; expand to a curated multi-asset set.

Scope:
- Event-driven scans: trigger focused scans on headline deltas (novelty/first-seen shifts).
- Narrative decay active (configurable half-life).
- Basic novelty weighting: de-duplicate echoes; boost first-source items.
- Universe: 10–20 narrative-sensitive symbols (news-dense equities + selective crypto).
- Explainability+: enrich Telegram + DB with anchor headlines, entities, and reason codes.

Acceptance criteria:
- Fewer, higher-quality signals per day; explainability artifacts stored for each signal.
- No duplicate triggers for the same story within a cooldown window.
- Stable event loop under typical data loads.

Out-of-scope:
- Backtesting; parameter governance.

Why now:
- Aligns signal timing with information flow; improves trust and review efficiency.

***

## V3 — Backtesting & Parameter Governance (leak-free)

Goal: Prove the edge with event-ordered replay and set disciplined parameter update cadence.

Scope:
- Event-ordered backtester: replay timestamped bars + headlines; compute features point-in-time only; evaluate forward returns (e.g., 15m/60m).
- Walk-forward validation: rolling windows for tuning/validation; prevent regime overfit.
- Parameter governance: small set of tunables (divergence T, confidence C, decay half-life H, TA weights) with monthly review/update cadence.
- Cohort analytics: performance by asset, time-of-day, volatility regime, event type.

Acceptance criteria:
- Reproducible backtest runs with documented in-sample/out-of-sample splits.
- Published thresholds from out-of-sample results.
- Cohort report identifying where edge concentrates.

Out-of-scope:
- Execution microstructure tweaks; live capital.

Why now:
- Converts plausible signals into evidence-backed settings; guards against hidden look-ahead.

***

## V4 — Execution Quality & Microstructure

Goal: Improve realized PnL by reducing slippage and avoiding thin/hostile microstructure.

Scope:
- Order tactics: prefer market in normal spreads; switch to limit or small slices when spreads widen or volatility spikes.
- Position sizing: scale notional by volatility and confidence; enforce max per-symbol and total risk caps.
- Cooldowns: stricter symbol/story-level cooldowns to avoid clustering.

Acceptance criteria:
- Measurable reduction in slippage vs. V3 baseline on paper.
- Fewer clustered entries around the same narrative burst.
- No increase in failure-to-fill beyond acceptable bounds.

Out-of-scope:
- Options overlays; streaming infra.

Why now:
- Good signals can still lose with poor fills; execution quality compounds returns.

***

## V5 — Data Breadth & Explainability+

Goal: Strengthen narrative signal; make audit and postmortems faster.

Scope:
- Optional crowd/attention proxy: carefully filtered social signals as secondary evidence (never primary gate).
- Source credibility learning: adapt weights for sources with consistent predictive value.
- Case file per signal: compact artifact bundling summary, quotes, entities, scores, divergence, and outcome link.

Acceptance criteria:
- Higher precision without a surge in false positives.
- Each trade explainable via a single, human-readable case file.

Out-of-scope:
- Automated model selection; deep learning expansions.

Why now:
- Layered evidence improves robustness and speeds iteration.

***

## V6 — Small Live Capital, Monitoring, and Safety

Goal: Move beyond paper with strict guardrails and observability.

Scope:
- Live deployment (small size): daily loss limits, per-trade caps, and circuit breakers (halt on repeated failures).
- Monitoring: hourly heartbeats, daily summaries, anomaly alerts (e.g., sudden silence in a usually noisy symbol).
- Versioning: tag every signal/trade with code/prompt/params version.

Acceptance criteria:
- Stable live operation for a defined trial period (e.g., 4–6 weeks) with automatic rollback path.
- Full reproducibility of any live decision.

Out-of-scope:
- Aggressive scaling; options strategies.

Why now:
- Real-world frictions manifest only with live orders; start small and safe.

***

## V7 — Regime Adaptation & Selective Automation

Goal: Scale where edge persists; adapt weights by simple regimes.

Scope:
- Regime-aware reweighting: small, interpretable set of regimes (e.g., volatility buckets, time-of-day) that adjust TA/narrative weights or thresholds.
- Selective automation: fully automate cohorts with robust edge; keep others alert-only or at reduced size.
- Quarterly research loop: refresh asset list, revalidate parameters, and retire decayed cohorts.

Acceptance criteria:
- Consistent performance across regimes with limited parameter drift.
- Documented decisions to scale or de-scale specific cohorts.

Out-of-scope:
- Ultra-low-latency infra unless justified by measured benefit.

Why now:
- Sustain performance as conditions change; scale responsibly.

***

## Cross-Cutting Workstreams

- Reliability & Resilience (all versions)
  - Strict JSON schemas; repair-then-reject for narrative; never trade on invalid parses.
  - Perplexity key rotation; retries with exponential backoff; timeouts; circuit breakers.
  - TA-only degradation mode when narrative is unavailable; safe halts on data failures.
  - APScheduler-based orchestration for interval/cron/event jobs[1][2][3].

- Documentation & Evidence (continuous)
  - Wiki: architecture, data contracts, prompts, test matrix, runbooks, decisions.
  - Dev log: daily entries of changes, issues, next steps.
  - Version tags baked into signals/trades for reproducibility.

- Compliance & Safety (V6+)
  - Environment separation; secrets in .env; logging hygiene; clear rollback procedures.

***

## Milestone Checklists

***

## Risks and Mitigations (snapshot)

- Narrative parser fragility → strict schema, repair-then-reject, curated test corpus.
- API rate limits/outages → key rotation, backoff, TA-only mode, circuit breakers.
- Look-ahead bias → event-ordered replay, lagged features, walk-forward validation.
- Overfitting/indicator bloat → small, interpretable feature set; robustness checks; governance cadence.
- Execution slippage → microstructure-aware order rules; measure impact before adding complexity.

***

## Operating Cadence

- Daily: run agent; update dev log at EOD; triage any errors; light wiki edits for new learnings.
- Weekly: review signals and cohort metrics; adjust backlog; curate wiki Decisions.
- Monthly: parameter governance meeting; walk-forward update; asset universe refresh.
- Quarterly: regime analysis; scale/retire cohorts; research new sources or tactics.

# Tracer Bullet — Comprehensive Roadmap Update (what’s done, what’s planned, and alignment)

Below is a consolidated, milestone-based roadmap compiled from our conversation history, organized by version, with explicit completion status, what shipped in each version, what’s next, and a clear alignment verdict versus the initial vision.

## Executive verdict

- Alignment: The project remains aligned with the original “Tracer Bullet” approach and the objective to build an interpretable, evidence-driven alpha engine that blends narrative with price/volume and ships incrementally with auditability and guardrails. We are not building “something else”; we’ve deepened exactly what we set out to do: reliability first, explainability, multi-asset foundations, and human-readable outputs.  
- Scope adjustments: Two timeline corrections were made for clarity, not direction changes:  
  - 24/7 cloud scheduling is now explicitly a later milestone (v6) after full testing, rather than earlier.  
  - v3.3 expands to all available crypto alts (not a small subset).  

## Completed milestones

### v1 — Hardening & Reliability [DONE]
- Preflight/health checks to validate environment and Telegram reachability; automatic directory setup for artifacts.  
- CLI wrapper with clear precedence (CLI > env > .env > defaults), centralized structured logging, INFO/DEBUG modes.  
- Robust Telegram delivery: plain-text default, truncation safeguards, graceful handling of 200/400/429, opt-out via flag.  
- Artifact retention: pruning runs/ and bars/ by most-recent N files; configurable via env.  
- Tests and CI: unit tests for divergence, payload schema, Telegram formatting, directory checks; CI lint/test flow.  
- Documentation: README, RUNBOOK, CONTRIBUTING, .env.example, payload docs.  

Why this matters: Establishes a dependable, reproducible core loop with safe ops, visibility, and clean artifacts.

### v2 — Crowd Immunity [DONE]
- Source Diversity Engine: shapes confidence by unique sources and penalizes “echo chambers”; artifacts added to payload.  
- Cascade/HYPE Detector: flags repetitive narrative lacking quant confirmation; bounded confidence deltas; payload enriched.  
- Contrarian Viewport: informational tag for potential crowd mistakes under certain narrative/price conditions; included in payload and one-liners.  
- Tests for diversity/cascade/contrarian presence and behavior.

Why this matters: Reduces herd-driven noise; improves robustness and interpretability of narrative signals.

### v3 — Bias Immunity + Sizing [DONE]
- Multi-timescale scoring: short/mid/long metrics and combined view with alignment gating.  
- Negative-confirmation checks: structured penalty logic with clamps; transparent reasons in payload.  
- Informational position sizing: confidence-to-R mapping, optional vol-normalization; reported without forcing trades.  
- Telegram lines reflect timescales, penalties, and sizing guidance; tests cover blending, clamps, and boundaries.

Why this matters: Adds disciplined structure to confidence, avoids over-trust in contradictory evidence, and connects confidence to position logic.

### v3.1 — Multi-Asset Foundations (Crypto + Stocks) [DONE]
- Universe configuration for symbols; symbol utilities for normalization and type detection.  
- Trading-hours awareness (crypto 24/7 vs equities RTH/extended/closed).  
- Stock bars adapter scaffold (with safe fallbacks), orchestration for multi-symbol scan, top-N ranking, digest utilities.  
- Payload extensions: symbol_type, market_hours_state, timescale presence.  
- Universe runs written to universe_runs/ with timestamping; optional mirroring to runs/.  
- Git integration hooks implemented behind env gates (off by default) for mirror/commit/push; robust try/except and logging.  
- Tests: universe loader, symbol utils, trading hours, stock adapter shape/safety, ranking determinism.

Why this matters: Enables consistent multi-asset scanning and reporting without breaking single-asset flow.

### v3.1.x — Human Digest Integration (crypto-first, number-free) [DONE]
- Added number-free, conversational digest formatter producing a consistent crypto-first report (BTC/ETH prioritized), including levels-to-watch (descriptive), entries/exits, and risk-based sizing bands.  
- Integrated into single-run flow: produced after artifacts are written, sent to Telegram, and printed to console; analyzer logic remains unchanged.  
- Optional prompt/style reference file; optional toggle to enable/disable digest output; safe defaults preserved.  

Why this matters: Delivers a human-ready narrative output without exposing raw metrics, boosting usability for decision-making while keeping the quantitative engine intact.

## In progress

### v3.1.x — Auto-commit/push hardening [IN PROGRESS]
- Goal: Ensure universe_runs/*.json and universe_runs/metrics.csv are staged, committed, and pushed automatically when env gates are on.  
- Current status: Commit/push plumbing exists behind env flags, but defaults are OFF; some terminals may miss staging for metrics.csv; logs need explicit “Auto-commit done.” / “Pushed.” confirmations.  
- Next steps: Confirm staging includes both JSON and metrics; add explicit result logs; verify non-interactive push across environments.

Why this matters: Eliminates manual staging/pushing and keeps repo artifacts consistent across runs and environments.

## Planned milestones

### v3.2 — Reliability Hardening (agent, non-24/7)
- Retries/backoff for transient providers; structured error handling and graceful skips.  
- Schema checks and digest self-check for thin or missing inputs; produce useful outputs even when evidence is sparse.  
- Clear alert notes when runs are skipped or degraded.

Why this matters: Improves run resilience and developer/operator trust before moving to continuous scheduling.

### v3.3 — Full Crypto Alt Coverage + Evidence Lines
- Expand coverage to all available liquid crypto alts (not just a few), using the same number-free template.  
- Add brief “why now” evidence lines per BTC/ETH and key alts, describing sentiment/news/structure vs price in plain English (no numbers, no links).  
- Maintain crypto-first priority and keep equities de-emphasized.

Why this matters: Completes crypto breadth while preserving interpretability, providing rationale for attention and bias.

### v3.4 — Execution Quality (paper/dry-run)
- Microstructure-aware tactics (market vs limit vs slices by spread/volatility) and cool-downs to avoid clustering.  
- Volatility-aware sizing with conservative caps.  
- Measure slippage versus baseline to confirm improvements.

Why this matters: Turns good signals into better realized outcomes while staying in a safe, non-live mode.

### v4 — Backtesting & Governance
- Event-ordered replay for bars+headlines; walk-forward validation; cohort analytics (asset/time-of-day/volatility regime).  
- Parameter governance cadence with documented thresholds from out-of-sample.  
- Reproducible backtests with clear in/out-of-sample splits.

Why this matters: Converts plausible intuition into evidence-backed settings and reduces hidden look-ahead risk.

### v4.1 — Paper Execution & Risk Controls
- Paper order lifecycle with audit logs; portfolio caps; kill-switches and guardrails.  
- Idempotency, reproducibility tags per decision/version.

Why this matters: Operational discipline before any live risk, ensuring safe failure modes.

### v5 — Data Breadth & Explainability+
- Optional attention/crowd proxies as secondary evidence (controlled, never primary).  
- Source credibility learning; compact case files per signal for audits/postmortems.

Why this matters: Improves precision and review speed without sacrificing interpretability.

### v6 — 24/7 Cloud Agent Run (after full testing)
- GitHub Actions (or equivalent) scheduled workflows: crypto-only every 15 minutes; mixed hourly with staggered minute.  
- Secrets management; non-interactive push; deterministic cadence; Telegram delivery.  
- Monitoring/rollback for the scheduler jobs.

Why this matters: Moves to truly autonomous operation only after we’ve finished hardening, coverage, and testing.

### v7 — Live Capital (small, guarded)
- Strict loss limits, circuit breakers, anomaly alerts, version tagging; limited deployment scope.  
- Rollback rehearsed; postmortem-ready artifacts.

Why this matters: Begin live exposure safely, learning from real frictions without over-scaling.

## Are we on plan?

- Yes, with a clarified timeline: Up through v3.1.x we are on track and consistent with the tracer-bullet philosophy—thin end-to-end, then harden, then expand coverage, then automate scheduling, then consider live.  
- The only course correction was to explicitly place 24/7 scheduling at v6 after testing, and to broaden v3.3 to cover all available alts; both are alignment fixes, not directional changes.

## Operational notes (scheduling and automation guardrails)

- When we reach v6, scheduled workflows can use cron-based triggers with sensible intervals; GitHub Actions supports 5-minute minimum cadence and may delay around top-of-hour loads, so staggered minutes are recommended to reduce contention[1][2][3].  
- If we explore interim in-app scheduling for dev or server use, APScheduler’s cron/interval triggers and background schedulers are a robust option before moving to managed schedules[4][5][6][7][8].  

## What to do next (immediate focus)

- Finish v3.1.x hardening: confirm staging includes metrics.csv and JSON; add explicit commit/push logs; test non-interactive push.  
- Start v3.2: implement retries/backoff and schema/digest self-checks; ensure graceful degradation and actionable logs when inputs are thin.  
- Prepare v3.3 backlog for “all alts + evidence lines” with the digest template unchanged in tone and structure.

These steps preserve our reliability-first approach and set us up for a smooth v6 shift to 24/7 automation after full testing.

------------------------------
updated roadmap

Here’s the revised, full, end-to-end, milestone-based roadmap, incorporating everything we’ve shipped, what’s in progress, what’s planned, and exactly where the Polymarket read-only viewport fits. It respects your directive: 24/7 scheduling at v6 (after full testing), v3.3 covers all available crypto alts, and execution on Polymarket is out-of-scope until ≥6 months of evaluation.

Executive summary
- We are on plan with the tracer-bullet philosophy: thin end-to-end → harden → breadth → evidence → evaluate → automate → (later) live.
- Completed through v3.1.x (including human digest). Auto-commit/push hardening is in progress.
- Polymarket read-only viewport is added in v3.3; evaluation in v3.4; any scheduling only at v6; live bets only after ≥6 months if metrics justify.

v3.1 — Multi-Asset Foundations (Crypto + Stocks) [DONE]
- What:
  - Universe config (config/universe.yaml); symbol normalization/type detection.
  - Trading-hours awareness (crypto 24/7; equities RTH/EXT/CLOSED).
  - Stock bars adapter scaffold with safe fallbacks.
  - Orchestrator (scan_universe.py): fan-out, rank Top-N (deterministic), digest_utils.
  - Payload additions: symbol_type, market_hours_state.
  - Universe artifacts: universe_runs/*.json and metrics.csv; optional mirror to runs/.
  - Git hooks behind env gates (OFF by default): mirror/commit/push; robust try/except and logging.
  - Tests: universe loader, symbol utils, trading hours, adapter shape/safety, ranking determinism.
- Why: Scale to multi-asset without breaking single-asset flow.

v3.1.x — Human Digest Integration (crypto-first, number-free) [DONE]
- What:
  - Digest formatter (scripts/digest_formatter.py) producing crypto-first, conversational, number-free digest:
    - BTC/ETH prioritized; entries/exits; levels-to-watch (descriptive); risk bands; Playbook footer; equities de-emphasized.
    - Qualitative bands from internal signals (polarity, confidence band, volume state, alignment, quality tags, readiness, sizing).
  - Integrated post-artifact write; Telegram + console; optional toggle/env.
- Why: Immediate human usability without exposing raw metrics.

v3.1.x — Auto-commit/push hardening [IN PROGRESS]
- What (to finish):
  - Ensure staging includes universe_runs/*.json and universe_runs/metrics.csv.
  - Explicit logs: “[Universe] Auto-commit done.” / “[Universe] Pushed.” or clear skip reason.
  - Verify non-interactive push across environments (SSH/PAT/credential helper).
- Why: Fully hands-off artifact versioning when enabled; defaults remain safe (OFF).

v3.2 — Reliability Hardening (agent, non-24/7) [PLANNED]
- What:
  - Retries/backoff, timeouts, and structured error categories for providers.
  - Schema and digest self-checks; graceful degradation for thin inputs.
  - Clear alert/skip notes; no crashes on partial data.
- DoD:
  - Transient failures recover; digest emits helpful fallbacks; logs actionable.
- Why: Strength before expanding breadth/outputs.

v3.3 — Full Crypto Alt Coverage + Evidence Lines + Polymarket (read-only) [PLANNED]
- Crypto breadth:
  - Include all available liquid crypto alts in the digest using the same number-free template.
  - One-liners per alt: bias/readiness/action; qualitative levels; brief rationale.
- Evidence lines:
  - BTC/ETH and key alts: 1–2 sentence “why now” in plain English (sentiment/news/structure vs price; no numbers).
- Polymarket (read-only) viewport:
  - Adapter (polymarket_adapter.py): list crypto-related markets (question, outcomes, implied probs, end_time, status, resolution source).
  - Bridge (polymarket_bridge.py): map TB’s qualitative read to stance (Engage/Stalk/Stand Aside), readiness (Now/Near/Later), edge label (market cheap/rich/in-line) expressed number-free; rationale line.
  - Digest: “Polymarket (crypto)” section with up to N curated markets (number-free).
  - Artifacts: store implied probs and TB internal probabilities for evaluation only; never shown in chat digest.
  - Toggles: TB_ENABLE_POLYMARKET=1, TB_POLYMARKET_MAX_ITEMS (default 3), TB_POLYMARKET_MIN_QUALITY.
- DoD:
  - Digest shows all alts; Polymarket section appears when enabled/quality met; artifacts carry eval fields.
- Why: Comprehensive crypto coverage + external odds comparison without execution or numeric leak.

v3.4 — Evaluation Pipeline (Polymarket + system reliability) [PLANNED]
- What:
  - Weekly evaluator: Brier score, log-loss, calibration curves, win-rate by edge label/cohorts; lead/lag analysis.
  - Event-ordered records; capture resolved outcomes; CSV/JSON summaries per week.
  - Reliability polish: ensure evaluation never breaks production runs; separate pipeline or safe post-process.
- DoD:
  - Stable weekly metrics; clear dashboards/tables; repeatable replay.
- Why: Build ≥6 months of evidence before any talk of live bets or scheduling.

v3.5 — Equities Bars Provider (background) [PLANNED]
- What:
  - Integrate a stable equities bar provider (Polygon/Alpaca/Yahoo) with throttling and fallbacks.
  - Remove fallback noise; improve equities structure read while keeping equities de-emphasized in digest.
- DoD:
  - Cleaner equities sections; no provider warning noise.
- Why: Quality uplift without changing crypto-first focus.

v4 — Backtesting & Governance (leak-free) [PLANNED]
- What:
  - Event-ordered replay of bars+headlines; lagged features only; forward returns evaluation windows.
  - Walk-forward validation; cohort analytics (asset, time-of-day, volatility regime, event type).
  - Parameter governance cadence; documented thresholds from OOS.
- DoD:
  - Reproducible backtests with clear splits; published settings with evidence.
- Why: Evidence-backed parameters; protect against look-ahead.

v4.1 — Paper Execution & Risk Controls (dry-run) [PLANNED]
- What:
  - Paper order lifecycle; portfolio caps; kill-switches/guardrails; audit logs; idempotency and version tags.
- DoD:
  - Operational discipline rehearsed; zero live risk; reproducible traces.
- Why: Prove operational readiness before live exposure.

v5 — Data Breadth & Explainability+ [PLANNED]
- What:
  - Optional attention/crowd proxies (secondary only).
  - Source credibility learning; compact “case files” per signal for audits/postmortems.
- DoD:
  - Higher precision without opacity; faster reviews.
- Why: Richer, explainable context while staying interpretable.

v6 — 24/7 Cloud Agent Run (after full testing) [PLANNED]
- What:
  - Scheduled workflows (GitHub Actions or equivalent):
    - Crypto-only every 15 minutes; mixed hourly (stagger minute).
  - Secrets management; contents:write permissions; non-interactive push.
  - Include read-only Polymarket viewport in schedule if metrics are satisfactory.
  - Monitoring, alerting, and rollback for scheduler jobs.
- DoD:
  - Cadence runs deterministic; artifacts/digests on schedule; safe rollback.
- Why: Autonomous operation only after reliability and evaluation are proven.

v7 — Live Capital (small, guarded) [PLANNED]
- What:
  - Strict daily loss limits, per-trade caps, circuit breakers, anomaly alerts, heartbeats; full version tagging.
  - If Polymarket ever advances to execution: separate, hard-gated adapter after ≥6 months of strong evaluation metrics; tiny notional pilot; separate risk caps.
- DoD:
  - Stable live trial; reproducible decisions; rollback rehearsed.
- Why: Learn real-world frictions safely.

Cross-cutting workstreams (ongoing)
- Documentation: keep README, RUNBOOK, ROADMAP, payload schema, digest spec, universe orchestrator docs, configuration, reliability, testing, git automation pages current.
- Observability: per-run metrics logs and compact CSV (universe_runs/metrics.csv), plus weekly evaluation outputs (v3.4).
- Safety: strict schema checks, graceful degradation, circuit-breakers for providers, TB_NO_TELEGRAM safe mode.
- Governance: version tags in artifacts and (later) in signals/trades; monthly review of parameters; quarterly regime review.

Immediate next actions
- Finish v3.1.x: staging for universe_runs/*.json + metrics.csv; explicit commit/push logs; validate non-interactive push.
- Start v3.2: retries/backoff, timeouts, schema/digest self-checks, graceful skips, alert notes.
- Prep v3.3 backlog:
  - All alts coverage in digest (template blocks and symbol list expansion).
  - Evidence lines (plain-English “why now”).
  - Polymarket read-only: adapter, bridge, digest section, artifact fields, toggles.

Definition of done roll-up
- v3.1.x: Human digest integrated [DONE]; auto-commit/push hardened [IN PROGRESS].
- v3.2: Runs resilient under transient failures; digest self-checks; clear skips.
- v3.3: All liquid alts appear; evidence lines added; Polymarket read-only section live; artifacts include evaluation fields (no numbers in chat).
- v3.4: Weekly Brier/log-loss/calibration delivered; event-ordered; robust.
- v6: 24/7 schedule active only after above proofs; rollbacks tested.

This is the authoritative plan going forward. If you want, I can also generate a one-page “Now → Near → Next” visual and add precise acceptance checklists per milestone.

Got it ✅ — we can fold the **“Telegram alternative” work** directly into the **v3.1.x** milestone so it’s part of the current line‑of‑effort, instead of pushing it to a later version.

Here’s how the updated **v3.1.x** scope will look:

***

 **v3.1.x — Human Digest + Delivery Hardening** *(updated)*

**Scope**
- **Crypto‑only Human Digest** *(already shipped)*:
  - BTC/ETH prioritised; full TFs (1h, 4h, 1D, 1W, 1M).
  - Stocks hidden from TG but kept in artifacts.

- **Telegram enhancements** *(already live)*:
  - Multi‑part send with [i/N] headers.
  - Weekly/Engine sections preserved.

- **🚀 New: Alternative delivery channel**:
  - Integrate **Discord webhook sender** with rich embeds for full digest delivery without size truncation.
  - Map digest sections to Discord embeds:
    - Embed 1: Header + Executive Take
    - Embed 2: Weekly + Engine
    - Embeds 3+: One per asset with all TFs
  - Automatic splitting across multiple messages if embeds exceed limits (≤10 embeds / ≤6,000 chars per message).
  - Configurable via `TB_ENABLE_DISCORD` and `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` env vars.
  - Keep TG send in parallel (for short-form digest or redundancy) while Discord becomes primary full‑length channel.

- **Ops hardening** *(already planned in 3.1.x)*:
  - Auto‑commit/push artifacts (`universe_runs/*.json` + `metrics.csv`); explicit logs for commit/push.
  - Reliability layer with retries/backoff and schema/digest self‑checks.
  - Graceful degraded‑run notes.

**DoD**
- Discord channel receives full, single‑send digest (no truncation, all TFs).
