# Roadmap (Milestone-Based) — Project Tracer Bullet

A living, milestone-driven plan from V1 tracer bullet to small live capital, emphasizing reliability, explainability, and leak-free validation.

Last updated: 2025-08-08.

## Guiding Objectives

- Ship an end-to-end tracer quickly, then harden.
- Keep features interpretable; earn complexity with evidence.
- Capture rich evidence per signal to build our proprietary dataset.
- Validate via event-ordered, leak-free backtests before scaling.

***

## V1 — Tracer Bullet (single-asset, end-to-end)

Goal: One clean loop from ingest → analyze → decide → log → notify, with optional paper order.

Scope:
- Single symbol: BTCUSD.
- Data: Alpaca bars(last 60–120m) + latest headlines.
- Narrative: dev adapter returns strict JSON; schema-validated; raw JSON stored.
- NLP: FinBERT headline sentiment blended with LLM polarity; exponential time decay.
- TA: RSI(14), MA(10 vs. 50) slope, MACD histogram, volume z-score → Price Score.
- Divergence: z(Narrative) − z(Price); thresholds gate entries (long-only).
- Execution: Alpaca paper order (market), idempotent client order IDs.
- Logging: SQLite signals, trades, prompts; store raw narrative JSON.
- Notifications: Telegram “style analysis” message per signal (human-readable rationale).

Acceptance criteria:
- End-to-end run produces at least one decision preview and, when enabled, a paper trade with full context logged.
- Narrative JSON parser rejects malformed payloads safely (no trade on invalid parse).
- Telegram messages include summary, scores, divergence, TA context, decision, and trace IDs.

Out-of-scope:
- Shorts; novelty weighting; backtesting harness.

Why now:
- Establishes the thin thread; surfaces integration risks immediately.

***

## V2 — Better Signals (event triggers, decay, explainability)

Goal: Reduce noise and improve precision; expand to a curated multi-asset set.

Scope:
- Event-driven scans: trigger focused scans on headline deltas (novelty/first-seen shifts).
- Narrative decay active (configurable half-life).
- Basic novelty weighting: de-duplicate echoes; boost first-source items.
- Universe: 10–20 narrative-sensitive symbols (news-dense equities + selective crypto).
- Explainability+: enrich Telegram + DB with anchor headlines, entities, and reason codes.

Acceptance criteria:
- Fewer, higher-quality signals per day; explainability artifacts stored for each signal.
- No duplicate triggers for the same story within a cooldown window.
- Stable event loop under typical data loads.

Out-of-scope:
- Backtesting; parameter governance.

Why now:
- Aligns signal timing with information flow; improves trust and review efficiency.

***

## V3 — Backtesting & Parameter Governance (leak-free)

Goal: Prove the edge with event-ordered replay and set disciplined parameter update cadence.

Scope:
- Event-ordered backtester: replay timestamped bars + headlines; compute features point-in-time only; evaluate forward returns (e.g., 15m/60m).
- Walk-forward validation: rolling windows for tuning/validation; prevent regime overfit.
- Parameter governance: small set of tunables (divergence T, confidence C, decay half-life H, TA weights) with monthly review/update cadence.
- Cohort analytics: performance by asset, time-of-day, volatility regime, event type.

Acceptance criteria:
- Reproducible backtest runs with documented in-sample/out-of-sample splits.
- Published thresholds from out-of-sample results.
- Cohort report identifying where edge concentrates.

Out-of-scope:
- Execution microstructure tweaks; live capital.

Why now:
- Converts plausible signals into evidence-backed settings; guards against hidden look-ahead.

***

## V4 — Execution Quality & Microstructure

Goal: Improve realized PnL by reducing slippage and avoiding thin/hostile microstructure.

Scope:
- Order tactics: prefer market in normal spreads; switch to limit or small slices when spreads widen or volatility spikes.
- Position sizing: scale notional by volatility and confidence; enforce max per-symbol and total risk caps.
- Cooldowns: stricter symbol/story-level cooldowns to avoid clustering.

Acceptance criteria:
- Measurable reduction in slippage vs. V3 baseline on paper.
- Fewer clustered entries around the same narrative burst.
- No increase in failure-to-fill beyond acceptable bounds.

Out-of-scope:
- Options overlays; streaming infra.

Why now:
- Good signals can still lose with poor fills; execution quality compounds returns.

***

## V5 — Data Breadth & Explainability+

Goal: Strengthen narrative signal; make audit and postmortems faster.

Scope:
- Optional crowd/attention proxy: carefully filtered social signals as secondary evidence (never primary gate).
- Source credibility learning: adapt weights for sources with consistent predictive value.
- Case file per signal: compact artifact bundling summary, quotes, entities, scores, divergence, and outcome link.

Acceptance criteria:
- Higher precision without a surge in false positives.
- Each trade explainable via a single, human-readable case file.

Out-of-scope:
- Automated model selection; deep learning expansions.

Why now:
- Layered evidence improves robustness and speeds iteration.

***

## V6 — Small Live Capital, Monitoring, and Safety

Goal: Move beyond paper with strict guardrails and observability.

Scope:
- Live deployment (small size): daily loss limits, per-trade caps, and circuit breakers (halt on repeated failures).
- Monitoring: hourly heartbeats, daily summaries, anomaly alerts (e.g., sudden silence in a usually noisy symbol).
- Versioning: tag every signal/trade with code/prompt/params version.

Acceptance criteria:
- Stable live operation for a defined trial period (e.g., 4–6 weeks) with automatic rollback path.
- Full reproducibility of any live decision.

Out-of-scope:
- Aggressive scaling; options strategies.

Why now:
- Real-world frictions manifest only with live orders; start small and safe.

***

## V7 — Regime Adaptation & Selective Automation

Goal: Scale where edge persists; adapt weights by simple regimes.

Scope:
- Regime-aware reweighting: small, interpretable set of regimes (e.g., volatility buckets, time-of-day) that adjust TA/narrative weights or thresholds.
- Selective automation: fully automate cohorts with robust edge; keep others alert-only or at reduced size.
- Quarterly research loop: refresh asset list, revalidate parameters, and retire decayed cohorts.

Acceptance criteria:
- Consistent performance across regimes with limited parameter drift.
- Documented decisions to scale or de-scale specific cohorts.

Out-of-scope:
- Ultra-low-latency infra unless justified by measured benefit.

Why now:
- Sustain performance as conditions change; scale responsibly.

***

## Cross-Cutting Workstreams

- Reliability & Resilience (all versions)
  - Strict JSON schemas; repair-then-reject for narrative; never trade on invalid parses.
  - Perplexity key rotation; retries with exponential backoff; timeouts; circuit breakers.
  - TA-only degradation mode when narrative is unavailable; safe halts on data failures.
  - APScheduler-based orchestration for interval/cron/event jobs[1][2][3].

- Documentation & Evidence (continuous)
  - Wiki: architecture, data contracts, prompts, test matrix, runbooks, decisions.
  - Dev log: daily entries of changes, issues, next steps.
  - Version tags baked into signals/trades for reproducibility.

- Compliance & Safety (V6+)
  - Environment separation; secrets in .env; logging hygiene; clear rollback procedures.

***

## Risks and Mitigations (snapshot)

- Narrative parser fragility → strict schema, repair-then-reject, curated test corpus.
- API rate limits/outages → key rotation, backoff, TA-only mode, circuit breakers.
- Look-ahead bias → event-ordered replay, lagged features, walk-forward validation.
- Overfitting/indicator bloat → small, interpretable feature set; robustness checks; governance cadence.
- Execution slippage → microstructure-aware order rules; measure impact before adding complexity.

***

## Operating Cadence

- Daily: run agent; update dev log at EOD; triage any errors; light wiki edits for new learnings.
- Weekly: review signals and cohort metrics; adjust backlog; curate wiki Decisions.
- Monthly: parameter governance meeting; walk-forward update; asset universe refresh.
- Quarterly: regime analysis; scale/retire cohorts; research new sources or tactics.
